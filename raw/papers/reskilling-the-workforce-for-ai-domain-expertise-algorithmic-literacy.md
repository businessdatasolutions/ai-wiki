 Abstract
 This study provides evidence that the value generated from AI and algorithms is amplified when
 the skills required to use these technologies are dispersed among workers with domain knowledge.
 This decentralization of technical expertise stands in contrast to other business technologies for
 which the complementary skills are primarily embodied in IT specialists. Using two workforce
 data sets, I show that 1) employers have been seeking greater expertise with algorithms from
 employees with domain knowledge, 2) algorithmic expertise in frontier firms has become more
 dispersed across those with domain knowledge, and 3) the market assigns higher value to firms’
 algorithmic investments when the relevant skills are decentralized, suggesting the presence of
 valuable workforce complements that can yield future productivity benefits from AI and data
 science investments. Finally, I show that the proliferation of no-code tools that democratize AI,
 data science, and algorithmic capabilities among workers with domain knowledge accelerates
 these changes. Workforce training implications are discussed.

1 Introduction
The impact of algorithmic decision-making on organizations is a topic of growing interest. Research
in this area has focused on the labor reallocation effects of AI and automation technologies (Ace-
moğlu and Restrepo, 2016; Autor and Salomons, 2018; Brynjolfsson et al., 2018; Raj and Seamans,
2018; Eloundou et al., 2023), but it has also demonstrated that these technologies are not simply
labor displacing (Agrawal et al., 2019; Gregory et al., 2022). Instead, these technologies are also
likely to complement workers in many jobs (Bessen, 2019; Autor et al., 2022), and a key theme of
the literature in this area is how humans can be most effective when working alongside algorithms
(Beane, 2019; Agrawal et al., 2019; Lebovitz et al., 2022).
 This paper presents new theory and evidence that a valuable workforce complement to the
effective use of algorithms by organizations is the decentralization of “algorithmic expertise” among
the firm’s domain experts. Algorithmic expertise refers to a worker’s ability to use and interact with
technology tools, such as machine learning and data science algorithms, predictive software, gener-
ative AI tools, and AI-powered analytics platforms, that are capable of autonomously generating
decisions or content. The definition of “algorithms” considered here includes AI and data science
tools but excludes tools like relational databases or web technologies that do not exhibit these
autonomous capabilities and require greater human input to guide the creation of their output. Do-
main expertise refers to the knowledge required to work in a specialized field such as nursing, sales,
marketing, or accounting.1 Prior work suggests that the effective use of algorithms may be unique
because it demands these two types of human capital to be integrated (Collins, 2004), particularly
in sensitive contexts like law or medicine where the tolerance for machine-based prediction error is
low (Kleinberg et al., 2018; Choudhury et al., 2020).
 The employer’s choice of hiring domain experts with algorithmic skills is a departure from

 This paper primarily uses the term “expertise” to signify knowledge in a field. The distinction between requiring
deep “expertise” versus “knowledge”, “literacy”, or “fluency” with these domains or tools has important theoretical and
practical implications, but making this distinction requires more detailed data than are available in the databases
used in this paper, so this distinction is left for future work.

how technical skills are normally distributed within firms, where technical knowledge is often cen-
tralized within specialized IT workers. It aligns with theoretical arguments about the optimal allo-
cation of knowledge and decision rights within firms (Garicano, 2000; Dessein and Santos, 2006).
While earlier technologies may have been effectively managed through specialized departments, the
general-purpose nature of AI and its deep integration into domain-specific processes suggests that
technical expertise must be more widely distributed. This distribution of algorithmic expertise across
occupations generates theoretical predictions about how AI and algorithmic technologies reshape
organizational boundaries and job design.
 Prior work has studied the centralization versus decentralization tradeoff in IT decision-
making authority (McElheran, 2012, 2014), but has placed less focus on how this tradeoff applies to
the distribution of technical skills across workers. This gap is important because the allocation of
skills, particularly algorithmic capabilities, presents unique challenges compared to questions related
to organizational structure. While centralizing authority or information involves primarily organi-
zational redesign, distributing technical skills requires significant human capital investment and
careful consideration of how different types of expertise complement each other. Understanding this
skills-based centralization tradeoff is especially critical as algorithms become more deeply embedded
in core business processes, requiring organizations to balance the efficiency gains of concentrated
technical expertise against the adaptability benefits of dispersed expertise.
 This study first develops theory that builds on the literature in job design and task allocation,
examining how algorithmic technologies differ from other foundational information technologies such
as databases or web technologies in terms of what is required to adapt them to specialized business
processes (Smith, 1776; Becker and Murphy, 1992; Teodoridis, 2017; Lindbeck and Snower, 2000).
The discussion focuses on how employers adapt jobs to technological change at the sub-occupational
level - that is, how individual roles evolve (Spitz-Oener, 2006). From this theoretical foundation,
I develop testable hypotheses about: i) how employers modify job roles to incorporate algorithmic
expertise, ii) the optimal distribution of algorithmic expertise across an organization’s decision-
makers, and iii) the relationship between this workforce adaptation and the value firms can generate
from these technologies.
 To test these hypotheses, I analyze two databases that capture corporate hiring and employ-
ment patterns. The first database contains a comprehensive collection of US job listings from 2013
to 2016. This dataset, used in previous studies examining the evolution of job skill requirements
(Deming and Kahn, 2018; Acemoglu et al., 2022; Goldfarb et al., 2023), provides insights into em-
ployer demand. The second database tracks the diffusion of technology skills across occupations,
as reported by workers, from 2008 to 2021, focusing on a large sample of public firms.2 I supple-
ment this dataset with occupational knowledge content from the Bureau of Labor Statistics O*NET
database and financial metrics from Compustat-Capital IQ.
 The analysis produces three findings. First, from the job postings data, I show that employers

have increasingly been searching for algorithmic expertise in non-technical occupations, in a pat-
tern that more closely resembles general-purpose office software skills (e.g., word processing tools)
than technical skills like database administration. By 2016, only one-third of the listings requiring
algorithmic expertise were for IT occupations. In non-IT occupations, these skills were particularly
likely to be embedded in listings requiring domain expertise.
 To assess factors that influence the spread of algorithmic skills among the firm’s domain
experts, a second analysis utilizes workforce data from a partially overlapping seven year panel that
extends through a period which saw greater AI adoption (2015-2021). In the large, public firms that
comprise the sample, algorithmic skills spread among non-technical domain experts with decision-
making responsibilities. This is consistent with the changes observed in the job postings, and stands
in contrast to what we observe for other information technologies. Moreover, the proliferation of
software innovations that make it easier to use algorithms, such as “no-code” tools, increased the
likelihood that domain experts acquired these skills.
 Given that firms appear to value workers with these skills, the third analysis examines whether
financial markets reflect this perceived value. It shows that investors assign greater value to firms’
AI and data science investments when made in tandem with these employment choices. This inter-
action is observed for data science in the earlier years in the panel, and it strengthens and becomes
more pronounced for AI investments in the later period of the panel. Robustness tests suggest that
the higher values assigned to these assets are unique to these technologies. Similar patterns do not
emerge for other technologies or for expertise in other categories of technical skill. Taken together,
the findings from these analyses of job vacancies, employment, and financial markets provide cor-
roborating evidence that the effective use of AI, data science, and other algorithmic technologies is
benefitted by decision-makers who can synthesize their domain expertise with technical capabilities.
 This research contributes to two academic literatures. First, by focusing on employers’ hir-
ing practices, it advances our understanding of how employment practices complement new IT
investments (Bresnahan et al., 2002; Black and Lynch, 2001; Caroli and Van Reenen, 2001; Bloom
et al., 2012). While prior work has viewed IT primarily as a tool for automating routine tasks, the
emergence of algorithmic technologies that handle complex, non-routine decisions has sparked new
questions about how these technologies shape firms’ demand for labor (Brynjolfsson et al., 2018).
This paper contributes to a literature that identifies specific management practices that enable firms
to effectively leverage predictive algorithms (Brynjolfsson et al., 2021; Zolas et al., 2021; Dixon et al.,
2021; Xue et al., 2022).
 Second, it contributes to a literature on how the adoption of algorithmic decision-making will
shape the future of work, which is becoming increasingly important as new technologies subsume
many of the tasks done by humans while simultaneously generating new areas of demand for human
labor (Agrawal et al., 2019). Most prior work on technical skills has focused on the IT workforce
(Ang et al., 2002; Mithas and Krishnan, 2008; Wiesche et al., 2019), but there has been some work
on the implications of technical skills for broader workforce outcomes (Atasoy et al., 2016; Deming
and Noray, 2020). Yet, the absence of more work in this area is notable given the growing demand

from students and workers from non-technical backgrounds for “coding” and other technical skills
and the contemporaneous reduction in the degree of skill required to use analytical and AI tools.
These findings, therefore, contribute to our understanding of how the human-algorithm connection
will shape the demand for skills as employers embrace these technologies.
 Beyond its contributions to the academic literature, these findings have implications for man-
agers who are implementing AI, data science, and other algorithmic technologies in their organiza-
tions. These findings suggest that managers should consider how to develop algorithmic expertise
among domain experts rather than solely relying on centralized IT departments or data science
teams. This is crucial in contexts requiring deep domain knowledge, such as healthcare or finance,
where field-specific requirements cannot be separated from technical implementation. The evidence
presented in this analysis suggests that the market rewards firms that integrate algorithmic ca-
pabilities with domain expertise, as these workers can better identify opportunities and translate
business needs into technical solutions.
 These arguments also suggest that managers may need to ensure that decision rights are lo-
cated with workers who can synthesize domain and technical knowledge effectively. This represents a
departure from how many technical decisions and capabilities have historically been organized within
firms. When algorithmic technologies are involved in complex, non-routine decisions, the decentral-
ization of algorithmic expertise and associated decision rights may enable faster experimentation
and learning cycles, as technically skilled domain experts can quickly iterate on algorithmic solutions
without the bottleneck of coordinating with a separate technical team for each adjustment.

2 Theory and Hypothesis Development

2.1 AI, algorithms, and domain expertise
How the use of algorithms affects job design depends on three factors: specialization, coordination,
and adaptation. Specialization allows for productivity gains, as in the example of medicine where
AI algorithms analyze images, freeing radiologists to concentrate on complex cases (Smith, 1776).
AI can lower coordination costs by synchronizing interdependent tasks, exemplified by supply chain
management where predictive models can efficiently align inventory, supply, and delivery schedules
(Becker and Murphy, 1992). A third factor is adaptation, with AI excelling in tailoring tasks to
local information (Dessein and Santos, 2006), such as the case of marketing professionals using AI
to create personalized advertising based on consumer behavior data. These adaptive capabilities are
particularly valuable where applying local knowledge is critical.3
 Balancing specialization and coordination has been a central theme of the literature on IT and
jobs because new technologies incentivize employers to adjust the mix of skills within occupations
(Spitz-Oener, 2006). Although specialization yields greater productivity in many contexts, Lind-
 3
 There are parallels for these arguments in the construction of teams. Using academic publication data, Teodoridis
(2017) shows that a decrease in the cost of acquiring new technical knowledge changes the optimal mix of expertise
when constructing diverse teams.

beck and Snower (2000) theorize that task-based complementarities in knowledge-rich jobs shift
work away from specialization towards more “holistic” work in which employees handle a diver-
sity of tasks. Multi-task work raises productivity when there are informational complementarities
among tasks because productivity in one task can be interdependent with activity levels in others
(Postrel, 2002).4 Computers complement educated workers because they automate routine tasks and
raise the productivity of front-line workers who can balance diverse tasks and benefit from these
complementarities (Autor et al., 2003; Bresnahan et al., 2002).
 While specialization and coordination tradeoffs affect many aspects of IT and job design,
this study examines algorithmic decision-making specifically, where successfully combining domain
and technical expertise remains an ongoing challenge. For example, consider a well-recognized and
standardized process used to balance data modeling decisions with business objectives in the data-
mining workflow, “CRISP-DM” (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) (Wirth and
Hipp, 2000; Chapman et al., 2000).5 This model separates the data mining process into six dis-
crete steps: 1) Business Understanding, 2) Data Understanding, 3) Data Preparation, 4) Modeling,
5) Evaluation, and 6) Deployment. Domain expertise in CRISP-DM is conceptualized as residing
outside of technical expertise and being drawn from other experts within the organization or from
outside clients. Studies of CRISP-DM have found that coordinating between workers with different
expertise is expensive and represents a major limitation of this approach (Saltz, 2021).
 Data science and AI technologies present unique challenges for integrating domain knowledge
into data-driven decision processes, because they autonomously generate decisions and recommen-
dations that can involve complex, non-routine cognitive tasks (Brynjolfsson et al., 2018; Agrawal
et al., 2018). For non-routine decisions, there can be high costs to the separation of technical and
domain expertise, as in the case of the radiologists described above working with AI-based diagnos-
tic recommendations. If the radiologist lacks understanding of how the AI model makes predictions,
they may either over-rely on its recommendations or dismiss valid insights, potentially compromising
patient care. Similarly, in financial trading, separating algorithmic expertise from market knowledge
can lead to costly errors when automated trading systems encounter novel market conditions that
require human judgment. As such, recent qualitative work in these and related settings emphasizes
that the integration of technical and domain expertise for AI and data science initiatives poses a
significant challenge (Beane, 2019).
 The literature on data science methods and processes has identified the challenges that arise
when domain expertise needs to be effectively injected into a data-driven workflow (Mao et al.,
2019; Choudhury et al., 2020; Park et al., 2021). These discussions argue that the iterative nature
 4
 Relative to changes in occupational demand, sub-occupational shifts have been less widely documented because
administrative data agencies do not capture it well. To fill this gap, scholars have turned towards alternative data
sources. A notable example is (Spitz-Oener, 2006), who uses German data to show that within-occupational change
was happening quickly in occupations that were being computerized. In that sample, within-occupational change
accounted for 36% of educational upgrading.

 Poll results from 2014 indicate that it is the most common method used for data mining and data science
projects, with about half of all respondents reporting using CRISP-DM and the other half divided over other
methods. See https://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/10/crisp-dm-top-methodology-analytics-data-mining-data-science-

of data exploration, experimentation, and learning required for data science favors generalists, who
have a diversity of skills, over specialists (Colson, 2019). The emphasis on decision-making and the
potential for algorithmic errors, the need for iteration, and the non-routine mapping between the
input data and output decisions sets these technologies apart from those where the output is an
input into an employee’s decision-making process rather than a decision itself (e.g., websites, cloud
storage, databases).
 A prominent example is the “data scientist” job title itself, which combines technical and
statistical acumen with domain expertise (Davenport and Patil, 2012; Provost and Fawcett, 2013).
The importance of domain expertise for effective data science has been discussed online6 , in industry
panels7 , and in the press (Oostendorp, 2019). Beyond data scientists, however, workers who can
couple domain expertise with technical skills are becoming important to many decision-making
contexts (Jha and Topol, 2016).8 Users of machine learning tools who operate in high-stakes contexts
must evaluate trade-offs when choosing which data to include in a model, how to construct model
features, or how to assign costs to prediction errors (Kleinberg et al., 2018). Research situated in
pharmaceutical industries has shown the importance of embedding the relevant human capital in
downstream occupations (Wu et al., 2019). Jha and Topol (2016) and Lebovitz et al. (2022) describe
the challenges healthcare workers face when interpreting the accuracy of machine learning output.

2.2 Hypothesis development
From a theoretical perspective, organizations face a trade-off in how they structure their techni-
cal capabilities. Centralizing IT and data science expertise into specialized departments enables
economies of scale and standardization. However, this creates coordination bottlenecks as domain
experts must repeatedly consult with technical teams to implement solutions. Conversely, distribut-
ing algorithmic capabilities directly to domain experts increases organizational agility and reduces
coordination overhead, but requires significant investment in training and risks inconsistent practices
across the organization. This tension between efficiency through centralization versus responsiveness
through distribution shapes how firms organize their technical workforce.
 The first hypothesis tested in this paper is:

 H1: Job listings that require algorithmic technology skills (e.g., machine learning, AI)
 are more likely to also require domain expertise when compared to job listings that require
 other technology skills (e.g., spreadsheets, databases) that cannot autonomously generate

 For instance, the notion that data-driven employers increasingly demand “bilingual” workers (i.e. individuals who
have both technical skills and domain expertise) was underscored by an announcement from MIT on their investment
in a new College for Artificial Intelligence. The goal of the college, said L. Rafael Reif, the president of M.I.T., is to
“educate the bilinguals of the future.” He defines bilinguals as people in fields like biology, chemistry, politics, history
and linguistics who are also skilled in the techniques of modern computing that can be applied to them. Additionally,
it is expected that the “bilingual” graduates who emerge from this new College — combining competence in computing
and in other fields — will be of enormous value to employers. New York Times, Oct 15, 2018. MIT Plans College for

 decisions or content.

 This hypothesis leaves open the important question of whether technical or domain experts
receive this bundle. Adaptation provides a context in which to theorize about the control of task
bundles in work environments. Where domain expertise helps with localized decision-making, orga-
nizations may prefer that non-technical domain experts, like those in finance and human resources,
receive these skills. An instructive example is “typing pools” which existed solely to provide typing
services within the organization. Over time, the typing task became part of the knowledge worker’s
job because local adaptation is important for documentation.9 This shift aligns with theories of
knowledge-based hierarchies, which suggest that workers closer to the frontline often have better
access to local information needed for decision-making (Garicano, 2000). Additionally, transaction
cost economics suggests that when tasks are highly interdependent and require frequent adaptation,
bundling them within a single role reduces costly coordination between workers (Williamson, 1979).
 Conversely, the use of algorithms may substitute for domain expertise in areas such as for-
eign language translation which could move the bundle away from domain experts. Determining
which domain experts or technical experts receive this bundle, therefore, is ultimately an empirical
question.

 H2: Domain experts are more likely to require algorithmic skills when their roles involve
 local decision-making.

 The distribution of who acquires this skill bundle could evolve over time, driven by changes in
the costs of becoming proficient with algorithmic tools. This dynamic aligns with theories of skill-
biased technological change, which suggest that the adoption of new technologies depends critically
on the costs of acquiring the complementary skills needed to use them effectively (Acemoglu, 2002).
If the costs of acquiring technical skills are high, it will be difficult and expensive to find workers
who have acquired both domain and technical expertise, and employers may forgo any productivity
gains associated with bundling these skills together. This reflects classic make-vs-buy decisions in
organizations, where high transaction costs can lead firms to maintain separate specialized roles
even when integration might otherwise be optimal (Coase, 1937).
 The barriers to using many tools, however, are falling as vendors compete to speed adoption of
their products in the workplace. This aligns with theories of technological diffusion that emphasize
how falling adoption costs accelerate the spread of new practices across organizations. Examples
include the embedding of complex machine learning logic in standardized software libraries (Rock,
2019), the proliferation of no-code tools like Tableau, and most recently, the growing abilities of large
language models to handle data sets and enable workers to conduct data analysis with no coding
background. These developments reduce the cognitive overhead required to use algorithmic tools,
making it easier for domain experts to perform technical tasks without extensive formal training.

 H3: The bundling of algorithmic skills with domain expertise should increase as the
 barriers to acquiring algorithmic skills decrease.

 Job reconfiguration of the type proposed in the prior hypotheses is costly, but firms have strong
incentives to pursue these changes. Prior work has shown that productivity-enhancing workforce
adjustments are needed to realize financial returns to IT investments (Black and Lynch, 2001;
Bresnahan et al., 2002; Caroli and Van Reenen, 2001; Bresnahan et al., 2002; Bloom et al., 2012). For
computing technologies that perform routine tasks, the literature has shown that allocating authority
to front-line decision makers yields higher productivity (Bresnahan et al., 2002), particularly in
environments where the value of decisions depends on rapidly changing external conditions (Pavlou
and El Sawy, 2006; Black and Lynch, 2001; Bresnahan et al., 2002).
 For algorithmic technologies, investors may value firms more highly when they employ work-
ers who can effectively leverage these tools for business objectives. While hiring workers with both
technical and domain expertise requires competing in tighter labor markets at higher wages, in-
vestors could recognize that building this human capital and the work structures that support them
represents an intangible asset that will generate future value. The coordination challenges between
technical and domain knowledge in data science and AI applications, discussed above, suggest that
workers who can bridge this gap by combining both skill sets may be especially valuable for realizing
productivity gains. The development of workflows that combine domain and algorithmic expertise
represents a valuable intangible asset because it is challenging for competitors to replicate these
workflows quickly, as the necessary human capital development requires significant investment in
training and organizational learning over time.

 H4: Firms in which algorithmic capabilities are distributed across domain experts receive
 higher market valuations for their algorithmic investments.

 The next sections describe the empirical tests and databases used to test the hypotheses
developed above.

3 Empirical tests
This section describes three empirical analyses used to evaluate whether algorithmic and domain
expertise are unusually valuable when bundled together: (i) whether employers are searching for
them together in job postings (H1 & H2 ), (ii) factors affecting firms’ incentives to make these
workforce changes (H3 ), and (iii) whether financial markets reward employers who make these
workforce changes (H4 ).

3.1 Tests of employers’ hiring preferences
The job vacancy data allows tests of whether employers simultaneously seek domain expertise and al-
gorithmic expertise when hiring non-technical positions. This analysis draws from a research stream
that uses large-scale job posting data to analyze the individual skills and the combinations of skills
that employers choose to list in job postings (Deming and Kahn, 2018; Braxton and Taska, 2023). In

 9

---

Equation 1, the dependent variable is a binary indicator of whether a job vacancy requires domain
expertise and i indexes the job listing.

 DOMi = αA ALGi + γi + ϵi (1)

 The model estimates correlations between this indicator (DOM ) and algorithmic expertise
(ALG). The regression includes other technical skills to contrast with the algorithmic skill measure
as well as a vector of control variables (γ) that includes job title10 , four-digit industry, and the
logged total skills in the listing. These estimates are compared with those from other models that
substitute other job attributes in place of domain expertise: i) social skills, ii) cognitive attributes,
iii) character, and iv) management skills.
 To evaluate why a combination of domain and technical expertise may be of value to these
employers, a second test evaluates other tasks that co-occur with these skills in job postings.

 T ASKi = βD DOMi + βA ALGi + βDA (DOMi × ALGi ) + γi + ϵi (2)

TASK indexes individual tasks that are part of the data-driven decision-making process. DOM
and ALG are binary indicators of whether the job vacancy requires domain expertise or algorithmic
expertise respectively, and i indexes the listing.

3.2 Incentives for job transformation
A second analysis uses firm-level employment data to evaluate factors – levels of employee decision-
making, ease of learning algorithmic tools, and a measure of the firm’s aggregate investment in
algorithm technologies – that may affect the firm’s incentives to make workforce changes (H2 &
H3 ). These analyses are conducted at (i) the firm-occupation level and (ii) the firm level. Prior work
has used firm-level data to evaluate how IT investment is correlated with the adoption of specific
work practices (Black and Lynch, 2001; Bresnahan et al., 2002; Caroli and Van Reenen, 2001) or
skill distributions (Levy and Murnane, 1996; Autor et al., 2003), including how IT adoption is
correlated with the skill attributes of jobs. Equation 3 takes a similar approach and tests whether
algorithmic skills are more commonly found in non-technical occupations with greater decision-
making responsibility:

 Log(ALGSKL)ijt = βDM K DM Kijt + Log(T OT SKL)ijt + γijt + ϵijt (3)

In this regression, ALGSKL is the count of algorithmic skills in the firm-year-occupation cell,
T OT SKL is the count of total skills reported by workers in that cell, i is the firm, j is SOC 6-digit
occupation, t is the year, and DM K indicates levels of decision-making needed in that occupa-
tion. This specification allows varying occupation characteristics, accounting for firm differences. A
variation of Equation 3 adds an indicator of whether the skill is easy to learn (EASY LEARN ) to

evaluate whether innovations that lower the costs of using these tools accelerates their spread to
domain experts.
 Turning towards a firm-level analysis, employers are incentivized to make these changes if
they are at the frontier of investment in algorithmic technologies (ALG IT ). This relationship is
evaluated by estimating correlations between a measure of a firm’s investment in algorithms and a
measure of the decentralization of algorithmic skills among a firm’s domain experts (ϕALG ):

 ϕALG
 it = ALG ITit + γit + ϵit (4)

In Equation 4, i and t are the firm and year respectively, ALG IT is a measure of the firm’s invest-
ment in algorithms, and γ includes firm-level controls for size, assets, employment, and industry.
This analysis tests whether these two factors are likely to be complements in production and it
serves as a prelude to the financial analysis in the next section.

3.3 Decentralized algorithmic expertise and firms’ financial value
The prior section analyzes the co-occurrence of algorithms and work practices in firms. To evaluate
whether this combination is valuable to firms, I examine how these joint investments affect firm
value. Prior research has attributed value to intangible assets by examining how IT-complementary
workplace practices are associated with higher productivity from firms (Black and Lynch, 2001;
Bresnahan et al., 2002). Another approach uses market valuations to reveal the value of intangible
assets like intellectual property and IT-related intangible capital (Hall, 1999; Brynjolfsson et al.,
2002), based on the premise that investors value these assets for their expected future returns.
These market value regressions include measures of the firm’s tangible capital as well as measures of
intangible assets (like patents, IT investments, or organizational practices) as explanatory variables.
This hedonic approach estimates the value of intangible assets that are correlated with market value,
after accounting for the value of the firm’s tangible assets.
 This paper uses this market value based approach to estimate the value of AI and data sci-
ence investments. This approach could be well-suited for this setting because many firms are still
adapting these technologies into their workflows. Market values reflect investors’ forward-looking ex-
pectations about future benefits, allowing us to detect value creation before it appears in traditional
productivity measures. If the workforce transformation described above creates valuable organiza-
tional assets, investors should assign higher valuations to firms making these investments (H4 ).
The following specification tests if investors assign higher value to firms that combine algorithmic
investments with decentralized algorithmic expertise:

 Log(M V )it =Log(AT )it + Log(P P E)it + Log(IT )it +
 (5)
 Log(ALG IT )it + ϕALG
 it + (Log(ALG IT )it × ϕALG
 it ) + γit + ϵit

In Equation 5, i indexes the firm and t is year. M V is the firm’s market value, and P P E and AT are

capital and other assets, respectively, which account for the value of a firm’s tangible assets. IT is a
measure of the firm’s aggregate IT investment, ALG IT is a proxy measure of the firm’s investment
in algorithms, and ϕALG is the standardized measure of the decentralization of algorithmic expertise
among occupations requiring domain expertise. The control variables (γit ) include year, employment,
and depending on the specification, industry at the four-digit NAICS level or employer fixed-effects.

4 Data sources and key measures

4.1 Key data sources
The empirical tests described above use data sources on a) how employers are adapting jobs to algo-
rithms and b) how the skill composition of the workforce is changing. These are supplemented with
financial data from public firms to assess how technological and workforce changes are connected
to the value that investors assign to firms.

4.1.1 Job postings database

When employers have job vacancies, they often post details on their web sites or on job boards.
These listings identify employer and job title, the geography of the position, the skills and education
sought from candidates, wages offered, and other fields relevant to the search process. In this analysis,
listings are used to measure when skills first appear in job ads and how skills co-occur in listings
with other skills.
 The listings are from Lightcast, a labor market analytics firm that 1) uses software to crawl
a “near-universe” of online job postings and 2) uses natural language processing to parse job infor-
mation.11 This provider collects and standardizes data from over 17,000 job boards and corporate
web sites, and these data are processed to ensure a listing is not counted multiple times if it is
posted in several places on the web. The processed data include posting date, metropolitan area,
employer, job title, educational requirements, certifications required, and skill expectations for each
vacancy. Prior work has used these data to study labor market dynamics including how AI related
skills spread across jobs and industries (Deming and Kahn, 2018; Acemoglu et al., 2022; Goldfarb
et al., 2023).
 Lightcast associates each listing with a BLS O*NET code and employers are tagged with a
North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) industry. Job openings list skills, such as
Python, Random Forest, Chemistry, Supply Chain, Accounting, Data Science, Teamwork, or Com-
munication which are standardized using a skill dictionary maintained by Lightcast. These skill
data are not the same as job “requirements”. Employers can omit skills from listings, some skills
may be assumed but not listed, and successful candidates may not need all of the skills in a listing.
 11
 Until June of 2022, Lightcast was known as “Burning Glass Technologies” and is referred to as such in much of
the prior work that has used this data set. These data were provided to me when the provider was still known as
“Burning Glass Technologies”. In this paper, for consistency, I use the name Lightcast throughout, including when
referencing the use of these data in prior papers.

Nonetheless, employers are likely to be thoughtful about the skills they place in listings because
including or omitting a skill can attract or repel the wrong type of applicant.
 The data collection process raises questions about uneven industry and occupational coverage.
Prior academic work has provided information on the sampling properties of these data. See, for
example, Appendix A of Deming and Kahn (2018), who conduct a comparison of the Lightcast data
with administrative data sources. Key findings from these comparisons are that these listings data
are over-represented in computer and mathematical occupations, as well as management, health
care, business, and financial occupations. The listings data under-sample blue-collar occupations.

4.1.2 Corporate employment database

The employment data are from Revelio Labs, a workforce intelligence company.12 Their databases
are constructed from a variety of online sources,13 and are similar in their informational content
to data posted on online professional networks such as LinkedIn. They cover a large fraction of
white-collar work in the US, including both public and private US firms, but the sample used in
this analysis is limited to public firms so observations can be connected with financial market data.
This data source has been less widely used in the literature than the job listings, so in Appendix
A, I present comparisons with administrative data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Like the
Lightcast data, these data are over-sampled in management, business, and technology occupations
and under-sampled in areas such as agriculture and manufacturing which is consistent with the
greater use of online professional platforms in knowledge-intensive occupations.
 This database is used to generate measures of annual firm-occupation-skill employment activ-
ity from 2008 through 2021.14 This panel provides information on how specific technical skills, like
“machine learning”, are distributed across occupations and employers. The records for each employer
include CUSIP identifier codes which allow them to be merged with external financial databases
such as the Compustat-Capital IQ data.

4.1.3 Supplementary data sources

To identify occupations requiring domain expertise, O*NET codes in the job listing data are con-
nected to the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) content model published by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics.15 The O*NET database has been widely used in academic research,16 is gov-
ernment administered, produced by surveying occupational experts, and contains information on
employment, wages, and the work content of US jobs. The O*NET taxonomy reports the knowledge
 12
 See https://www.reveliolabs.com/. This analysis is based on a data extract provided on 2022-04-29.
 13
 Scholars have convincingly argued that the lack of firm-level data on workforce skills is a significant constraint
for understanding how firms are adjusting to technological change (Frank et al., 2019; Raj and Seamans, 2018).
 14
 The provider identifies some limitations with skill reporting. The profile data is aggregated from various sources
that collect publicly available profiles. In May 2021, user skills were removed from most public profiles. Since then,
the provider has been imputing (predicting) skills and indicates whether a skill on a profile is reported or imputed.
As the imputation algorithm is unknown to me, I restrict the analysis to data up to 2021.
 15
 See https://www.onetonline.org.
 16
 One notable example of its use for examining technical change is Autor et al. (2003).

required for occupations.17 Finally, the analyses of market value use firms’ financial and employment
data from Compustat-Capital IQ which was collected through the WRDS data service.

4.2 Sample construction and key measures

4.2.1 Sample construction

For the job listings analysis, the sample includes all listings in the data set from months ranging
from January 2014 to June 2016 for a total of 30 months of job listings data. The number of listings
for any given month ranges from just under 2 million listings to up to 2.5 million listings for a total
sample across the 30 months of 60,769,351 listings. However, as described below, the regression-
based analyses on these data restrict the sample to a single month and to job listings with a specific
set of skills which significantly lowers the sample size for those analyses.
 The Revelio workforce sample, which forms the core of this analysis, includes firm-occupation-
year-skill counts for the years 2015 to 2021. To merge these figures with financial data from Capital
IQ, the sample is limited to public firms, producing a sample of 7,198 firm-years. Table 1 reports
summary statistics for a single year from the mid-point of this panel (2018). The statistics are
reported in logs because logged variables are used in the multi-variate regressions.
 Firms in this sample are large, with an average market value of over 57 billion dollars and
almost 30,000 employees. The average firm in this sample has around 1,000 IT workers. Table 2
shows the distribution of these firms across NAICS 2-digit industries. Although there are firms in
every major sector, the Manufacturing, Information, and Finance and Insurance industries together
comprise almost 90% of the overall sample. The construction of key variables used in the analysis
is described below.

4.2.2 Employee algorithmic expertise (ALG)

Skill data are used to measure whether employees have or require algorithmic expertise. A key
challenge when using workforce skills for empirical analysis is the mapping of granular skills to
meaningful expertise measures.18 Recent published papers that use large quantities of archival,
digitally collected workforce data have used manual mappings. For example, Abis and Veldkamp
(2024) manually assign skills to “Data Management”, “Analysis”, “Old Technology”, and “AI” cate-
gories and Goldfarb et al. (2023) select a cluster of skills related to machine learning technologies for
their analysis. Deming and Kahn (2018) curate words and phrases in the Lightcast data associated
with different job skills, including cognitive, social, character, and computer categories. The litera-
ture on the impact of AI technologies on labor displacement has also generated their own rubrics
for measurement (Brynjolfsson et al., 2018).
 17
 The O*NET data is periodically revised to reflect the changing structure of the US workforce. Although it was
revised in 2019, I use the earlier version to match the O*NET codes in my version of the Lightcast data, which were
based on the taxonomy before the revision took place.
 18
 Because of the growing interest in the “future of work”, the construction of taxonomies that make sense of
emerging sources of skills data is an active and ongoing area of research among businesses and information agencies.
For example, see recent efforts by Nesta in the UK or Lightcast.

 14

 This analysis takes a similar approach but it uses categorizations generated by the data
providers themselves, who use clustering methods to group skill categories into different technology
areas like “data science”, “AI”, or “Big data”. Appendix B delineates the skill categories that fall into
each of the technological groups used in this analysis. For algorithms, examples of these base-level
categories include machine learning, business analytics, julia, and natural language processing and
each of these contain more detailed skills. For instance, machine learning is a skill category that
includes skills like “deep learning” and “supervised learning” within it.
 Skills in the AI and data science technology categories are combined to develop indicators of
algorithmic expertise at the individual level. At the worker level, a record (job listing) is denoted as
having (requiring) algorithmic expertise (ALG) if it has at least one skill falling into this category.

4.2.3 Domain expertise (DOM ), decision-making (DM K), and other attributes

Job-level measurement of domain expertise is constructed to be consistent with the measurement
of algorithmic expertise. A binary indicator (DOM ) takes the value 1 if an employee reports hav-
ing at least one type of domain knowledge in their skill set where the list of domain knowledge
categories is extracted from the O*NET dictionaries, which identify all of the possible knowledge
domains with which US-based jobs may require familiarity.19 These domains are extracted from
the “Knowledge” table in O*NET, which describes “organized sets of principles and facts applying
in general domains.” 20 From the full list, Computers and Electronics, Engineering and Technology,
Telecommunications, and Mathematics were removed because they overlap with measures of algo-
rithmic expertise.21 Similarly, the level of Decision-making for an occupation (DM K) is retrieved
from the O*NET database which provides this measure on a scale of 1 through 7 for each six-digit
occupation.
 Beyond algorithmic and domain expertise, the analysis uses indicators of skills related to
cognitive, social, character, and management job attributes. The construction of these attributes
was based on prior work that uses the Lightcast data source to construct these measures (Deming
and Kahn, 2018). As with measures of algorithmic and domain expertise, records are coded as
needing these attributes if the listing contains at least one related skill.22
 19
 See https://www.onetonline.org/find/descriptor/browse/Knowledge/.
 20
 The domain categories identified in the O*NET knowledge set are Administration and Management, Biology,
Building and Construction, Chemistry, Clerical, Communications and Media, Customer and Personal Service, De-
sign, Economics and Accounting, Education and Training, English Language, Fine Arts, Food Production, Foreign
Language, Geography, History and Archeology, Law and Government, Mechanical, Medicine and Dentistry, Personnel
and Human Resources, Philosophy and Theology, Physics, Production and Processing, Psychology, Public Safety and
Security, Sales and Marketing, Sociology and Anthropology, Therapy and Counseling, and Transportation.
 21
 It is important to contrast this approach with one in which jobs would be identified as requiring domain expertise
based solely on titles. Such an approach would impose the restriction that jobs with the same title cannot differ in
their knowledge content. Relaxing this restriction is important for this analysis because it allows for an analysis of
the diffusion of new skills into occupations (i.e. sub-occupational change) rather than changes to the occupational
mix which is central to this analysis.
 22
 Deming and Kahn (2018) construct these job attribute measures based on whether a listing has a skill related
to the attribute. These skills, as reported in Table 1 of that paper, are: cognitive [problem solving, research, analyt-
ical, critical thinking, math, statistics], social [communication, teamwork, collaboration, negotiation, presentation],
character [organized, detail oriented, multitasking, time management, meeting deadlines, energetic], and management

 15

4.2.4 Organizational algorithmic expertise (ϕALG )

At the organizational level, algorithmic expertise measures are constructed as the fraction of workers
with algorithmic skills (%ALG) in occupation groups highest in their domain knowledge require-
ments.23 For organization i in year t, an aggregate measure of the dispersion of algorithmic skills
across these occupational groups (ϕALG ) is computed as:

 (%ALGit − M EAN (%ALG))
 ϕALG
 it = (6)
 ST D(%ALG)

Firms in which employees in these occupations have more algorithmic skills have larger ϕALG val-
ues.24 For some robustness tests reported below, parallel measures are constructed for other tech-
nological categories (e.g., ϕCLOU D ).

4.2.5 Firms’ investments in algorithms and other technologies

Obtaining consistent, firm-level measures of IT investment spanning multiple years has been a
persistent challenge in the academic literature (Tambe and Hitt, 2012). IT investments are not
consistently recorded on balance sheets, so scholars often leverage alternative sources to create
proxy measures, such as hardware investment measures collected by marketing surveys, IT keywords
referenced in legal filings, and IT employment or salaries (Lichtenberg, 1995; Brynjolfsson and
Hitt, 1996; Tambe, 2014). The rationale behind the last approach is that human capital is the
largest component of a firm’s digitization investment and it has become even more important for
AI and data science investment because much of that software stack is open-source, leaving no
documented investment trail, and because much of the hardware is cloud-based and poorly measured
by instruments that record the firm’s owned servers and PCs. Conversely, most frontier software
requires technical expertise to install and maintain, so quantities of complementary, technical human
capital may be the most accurate available accounting of a firms’ technology investments.
 This method is used to create metrics for a firm’s technological assets. It follows prior work
where proxy investment measures are constructed as quantities or intensities of skills relevant to
[project management, supervisory, leadership, management (not project), mentoring, staff]. Deming and Kahn (2018)
also include writing, customer service, financial, computer, and software job attributes in their analysis but those
attribute families are not included in this analysis.
 23
 Occupational areas requiring higher levels of domain knowledge were identified using O*NET and include: 11-0000
(Management Occupations), 13-0000 (Business and Financial Operations Occupations), 17-0000 (Architecture and
Engineering Occupations), 19-0000 (Life, Physical, and Social Science Occupations), 23-0000 (Legal Occupations), 29-
0000 (Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations), 21-0000 (Community and Social Service Occupations),
25-0000 (Education, Training, and Library Occupations), 33-0000 (Protective Service Occupations), and 49-0000
(Installation, Maintenance, and Repair Occupations). Within these areas, the list of occupations was further restricted
to those in the top half of jobs in terms of the importance of domain knowledge for performing the job.
 24
 One limitation of the skills data is that they are associated with individuals rather than specific job roles, which
complicates determination of when these skills were acquired during their careers. As a result, some workers identified
as possessing algorithmic skills may not actually have them at the time of measurement. If workers at these firms are
more likely to acquire these skills later in their careers, this measurement error could suggest that these employers
have workforce policies that promote this type of skill development over time. In such cases, the estimates may
partially reflect differences in employers’ skilling opportunities rather than the actual market return on these skills.

the technological domain (Tambe and Hitt, 2012).25 This view of the dichotomy between technical
workers and non-technical occupations is similar to work that treats the employment of technically
skilled workers as the main investment into the construction of digital assets that can be subsequently
deployed by an organization to achieve its business goals (Hall et al. (2000) calls this “e-capital”).
Investments in aggregate IT or its sub-categories (i.e., ALG − IT , IT , DS − IT , AI − IT ) are
computed as the quantity of relevant skills in the firms’ IT workforce in a given year. Because the
firm-level regressions include employment measures, the “stock” of skills in a technological area can
be interpreted as the intensity of investment in that domain.26

4.2.6 Financial variables, assets, and industry classification

The Compustat-Capital IQ data are used to construct employer-year measures for total market
value, employment, industry classification, the value of PPE (property, plant, and equipment), and
other assets. As discussed earlier, the use of Capital IQ financial data necessitates limiting the
sample to public firms. Industry variables for these firms are retrieved at the four-digit NAICS level
(North American Industry Classification System). Total market value is computed as described in
an existing literature relating intangible assets to firm value (e.g. see the Appendix of Brynjolfsson
et al. (2002) which describes variable construction). It is computed as the value of equity at the end
of the fiscal year plus the value of preferred stock plus total debt which represents the total worth
of a firm as assessed by the financial markets. Assets are computed as total assets minus PP&E.

5 Results

5.1 Model-Free Evidence

5.1.1 The growth of algorithmic expertise in non-technical job postings

Figure 1b illustrates the growth rate of algorithmic skills in non-technical job listings from 2013 to
2016. Each x-axis tick corresponds to one month and the y-axis is the coefficient estimate (β) from
the logistic regression ALGi = βt ti + ϵi where i is the listing, t is a vector of dummy variables for
months since January 2013 when a vacancy was posted, and ALG indicates whether an algorithmic
skill appears in a job listing. The likelihood of an algorithmic skill appearing in a non-technical
occupation listing rises throughout the sample.
 Figure 2a shows the extent to which specific technology skills, including but not limited to
algorithmic skills, are bundled with domain expertise in one month of the Lightcast data (January
2016). Algorithmic skills, shown in blue, appear more frequently alongside domain expertise (ex-
 25
 Like most firm-level measures, this approach records investments with measurement error. See Appendix B for a
brief discussion.
 26
 The main findings are robust to an alternative construction of this measure based on quantities of technical
workers with at least one skill in the relevant domain which has a slightly different interpretation (e.g. quantities of
AI engineers, rather than the intensity of AI skills in the tech workforce). Those results are not shown due to space
constraints but are available upon request.

tending further rightward) and in this respect are similar to widely-used business tools like Excel
and ERP systems that are prevalent in non-technical workflows. Figure 2b indicates that algorith-
mic skills, again colored in dark blue, are more commonly found in job listings for non-technical
occupations than are other technical skills. Predictive analytics, data science, and data analysis are
only slightly less dispersed than skills related to the Microsoft Office Suite, which supports the claim
that employers are increasingly bundling algorithmic skills with domain expertise.

5.1.2 Algorithmic expertise in the workforce data

Job listings indicate what employers want. However, they do not indicate whether these listings
represent hard requirements or instead, are an employer “wish list” or whether the vacancies requiring
these skills are even ultimately filled. Corporate employment data can be informative about whether
the changes indicated by these listings are reflected in the workforce. Analyses of these data are
shown in the four quadrants of Figure 3.
 Figure 3a shows that algorithmic skills have become more dispersed in non-technical occupa-
tions in these firms. The y-axis is the intensity with which a skill appears in business, management,
and financial occupations, with levels depicted relative to their 2008 values. There is steady growth
in the rate at which AI and data science skills have penetrated these occupations, consistent with
the evidence from job vacancies in Figure 1b. By 2021, these skills appeared in 10% more of these
occupations than in 2010. In contrast, skills corresponding to two other categories, network and
cloud technologies, became increasingly specialized, and the incidence of mobile skills remained flat.
 Figure 3b shows how the measure ϕALG (Equation 6) varies across industry and time. It is
highest in the Information, Professional Services, and Finance industries, which is consistent with
press reports about the adoption of AI and data science in these industries (Lohr, 2024). Retail has
climbed rapidly which may reflect the growing use of consumer data for prediction. Levels are lower
in Healthcare although they have been climbing.
 Figure 3c depicts annual changes in ϕALG after separating firms into quartiles according to
their market values in the final year of the sample (2021). ϕALG is greatest in higher quartiles
and the differences are largest in the earlier years of the sample, which is consistent with a labor
market where workers with these skills are in high demand and in which higher value firms are at an
advantage when attracting them. In the last years of the sample, however, ϕALG converges across
quartiles, suggesting that supply-side changes have made it easier for employers with fewer resources
to attract workers with these skills. The fourth quadrant (Figure 3d) uses data from the final year
of the sample and plots firms’ investments in algorithms against ϕALG where the bubble size reflects
the firm’s market value. The largest circles (colored in blue) are those commonly referred to as “big-
tech” firms. We can see that firms contemporaneously invest in algorithms and in business-facing
workers with algorithmic skills.

5.2 Correlation tests: Domain expertise and algorithmic skills
From model-free evidence, we turn towards empirical tests of our hypotheses, beginning with Equa-
tion 1. Figure 4a depicts estimates of αA . The sample is a single month (Jan 2016), and the unit of
observation i is the job listing. In this sample, algorithmic skill is a predictor of domain expertise
required in a job. The regression includes job-title fixed effects so the finding persists after remov-
ing the effects of job title differences (Hypothesis 1). The full set of estimates from Equation 1
can be found in Appendix C and indicates negative correlations with data management, which is
consistent with database skills being more centralized within IT occupations. We observe positive
correlations between the use of algorithms and social and cognitive skills and negative correlations
with management-related job attributes. This negative relationship suggests that employers are not
bundling people leadership (character and management) with algorithmic skills.
 To provide evidence on why these skills appear together in listings, Figure 4b illustrates
βDA from Equation 2. Algorithmic and domain expertise most often appear together for positions
that also require Presentation and Decision-making. Interpreting, communicating, and acting on
data output appears to benefit from a synthesis of data and domain expertise. In contrast, this
combination of skills is negatively correlated with tasks related to Data management and Data
modeling which are tasks may not favor generalists who bring a diversity of skills to the task.

5.3 Regression tests: Incentives for job transformation
Table 3 reports the results of empirical tests from Equations 3 and 4 on the workforce data. In
a reflection of Figure 4b from the job vacancy data, column (1) indicates that domain experts for
whom decision-making is important are more likely to have algorithmic skills (t=3.50) (Hypothesis
2). The significance of this estimate remains after including firm fixed-effects (Column (2)) which
eliminates the role of static firm differences in driving these relationships, such as heterogeneous
demand for decision-making.
 Columns (3) and (4) test the proposition that a reduction in the cost of using algorithmic
tools speeds the diffusion of these skills into non-technical occupations. Columns (3) and (4) separate
algorithmic skills according to whether the skill is easier to learn, using as a proxy measure whether
the technology is a “no-code” tool.27 These tools comprise a small fraction of all technical skills
so the main-effect is negative (t=-28.88). Column (4), however, indicates that tools that are easy
to learn see greater uptake among non-technical decision-makers (t=4.29) (Hypothesis 3). This
finding supports a causal interpretation subject to the assumption that these tools perform the
same functions as their code-based counterparts. If these categories of tools perform substantially
different functions, however, it limits a causal interpretation of these findings.
 Columns (5) and (6) aggregate the data to the firm-year level by occupation and test if al-
gorithmic expertise is more decentralized among domain experts (ϕALG ) at employers that invest
 27
 Technologies are identified as being in this category using GPT-4 based labeling. The use of Large Language
Models for data annotation has been shown to be effective in domain-specific tasks and is becoming increasingly
common in the literature (Møller et al., 2023).

in algorithms, which would be predicted if these investments are complements in production. In-
vestments in algorithms and ϕALG are correlated after controlling for firm characteristics like size
and industry that may otherwise influence co-investment patterns. These correlations are robust to
including firm fixed-effects (t=2.34).
 These findings suggest that firms should view AI and algorithmic investments as part of a
broader organizational transformation that requires complementary human capital investments. The
correlations between algorithmic investments and decentralized expertise (ϕALG ) suggest that suc-
cessful AI adoption requires building technical capabilities throughout the organization, particularly
among domain experts and decision-makers. Second, the evidence that no-code tools see greater up-
take among non-technical decision-makers suggests that tools and technical advances that lower the
barriers to algorithmic adoption may accelerate the development of these benefits.

5.4 Regression tests: ϕALG and financial value
Table 4 reports estimates from the market value regression in Equation 5 on a seven-year panel
of public firm investments (2015-2021). Columns (1) through (3) include year and 4-digit industry
fixed-effects. Column (1) reports results of market value on measures of IT investment, assets,
capital (PPE), and employment where all of these variables are entered in logs. As prior work has
also found (Brynjolfsson et al., 2002), financial markets assign economic value to investments in
general IT capital (t=3.79). After adding algorithmic investment into the regression, the coefficient
on general IT capital falls to zero suggesting that the market returns to IT investment are principally
from frontier investments, as represented in this panel by AI and data science investments (t=3.93).
 Column (3) reports estimates from the full specification shown in Equation 5 that includes
the interaction term between investment in algorithms and ϕALG . The main effect on algorithms
is similar to column (2) (t=3.80) but the interpretation of the interaction is that these technical
investments are valued an additional 15% higher in firms where ϕALG is one standard deviation
above the mean (t=2.67). This supports the argument that contemporaneous investment in ALG
and ϕALG builds valuable intangible assets needed to produce a future stream of AI goods and
services (Hypothesis 4). Column (4) adds firm effects instead of industry effects. Including firm
effects drives the coefficients on algorithms, ϕALG , and the interaction term, to zero. This may reflect
the limited variation in this relatively short panel, but another interpretation is that there are high
adjustment costs for firms building these assets. Within the limited range of this panel, unobserved
differences across firms may explain most of the heterogeneity in firms’ endowments of these assets.
One way to probe this argument is to separate extensive and intensive margins of investment for
algorithms. Column (5) substitutes a measure indicating if ϕALG is above or below the mean for
firms in the sample. The results are similar to those in column (3) (t=3.00). By eliminating within-
firm variation, they show that across-firm differences are more important for these estimates. Firms
have a limited ability to change their asset mix in the years covered in this sample.
 An interpretation of these findings is that firms cannot simply invest in AI and expect returns
– the value of AI investments depends critically on having domain experts who can use these tools

 20

effectively. The premium for firms that combine AI investments with algorithmic-skilled domain ex-
perts indicates this is not just a technical challenge, but an organizational one. The firm fixed effects
results suggest significant adjustment costs in building these capabilities. Organizations likely need
sustained, multi-year investments to develop the right combination of technical infrastructure and
human capital. This may explain why early movers in AI adoption currently maintain advantages,
even as the underlying technologies become more widely available.
 These three sets of analyses from the job vacancies, employment data, and financial markets
suggest that in the last decade, (i) employers have been adjusting job search to find domain experts
with expertise in algorithms, (ii) domain experts in decision-making positions increasingly have
algorithmic skills, and (iii) employers that match their algorithmic investments with these workforce
changes realized greater market valuations, suggesting the presence of valuable intangible assets in
these firms. This evidence collectively supports the primary conclusion of the paper that a greater
level of technical skill in a firm’s domain experts is a valuable complement to its use of algorithms.

5.5 Effect heterogeneity and robustness tests
The average effects shown in Table 4, including the lack of a relationship indicated in column (4),
could mask variation across firm types. For instance, these effects may vary with firm size due to
coordination costs and organizational complexity (Garicano and Hubbard, 2009). When technical
and domain knowledge are separated, the increased organizational layers and communication chan-
nels in large firms can create bottlenecks and slow decision-making. Workers who combine both
skill sets may be especially valuable in this context as they can make informed technical decisions
without extensive back-and-forth consultation. Furthermore, larger firms often operate in multiple
markets, increasing the value of workers who can adapt algorithmic tools to different business con-
texts. Smaller firms, in contrast, may have simpler organizational structures with fewer coordination
challenges, reducing their need for bilingual workers. This suggests that the relationship between
value and distributing algorithmic capabilities across domain experts may be stronger in larger
firms, which is consistent with patterns observed for other digital investments (Tambe et al., 2020).
 Figure 5 reports estimates of the main interaction term for Equation 5 where the sample
is divided by firm size (separated by tercile). The financial returns are greater for larger firms,
likely due to either higher coordination costs or advantages in hiring skilled workers and deploying
technologies. The first explanation would persist over time but the second may fade as market
supply adjusts. Figure 3c suggests that both effects are at play.
 The findings reported so far obscure technological changes over the sample period. This anal-
ysis has combined AI and data science investments within the same broad category, despite the
fact that the technological frontier has evolved from data science toward AI over our sample period.
Table 5 separates these technologies and divides the panel into the years before and after 2018. The
first two columns suggest a relationship between data science investment and market value during
the earlier period, but there is no correlation with AI. In the later period, the estimates on AI and
Data Science are both positive and significant suggesting greater market value from AI investment

in the later period. Columns (3) and (4) introduce interaction terms with skill decentralization for
these technologies (ϕDS and ϕAI ). During the early period, the interaction term for data science
investments shows positive returns while the AI interaction has a negative coefficient. This pattern
reverses in the later period, where the AI interaction suggests positive and significant returns while
data science returns become less precise. The differential pattern between AI and data science is
informative - the complementarity between domain and algorithmic expertise may be more critical
for AI technologies compared to data science due to its autonomous decision capabilities and the
black-box nature of many AI models.
 Figure 6 summarizes robustness tests that suggest the market value tests reported above are
likely due to the hypothesized theoretical relationships rather than omitted variable bias. These
tests focus on the interaction between AI and ϕAI in the last two years of the sample which is the
window in which these patterns appear to be most salient. Figure 6a retains the ϕ measure but
interacts it with different technology investments (investments in data and networks, respectively).
The theoretical discussion suggests we should observe the strongest correlations with investment in
algorithms like AI, which is the pattern we observe. Neither of the interaction terms created using
the other technologies exhibits meaningful correlations, which indicates that correlations between
market value and the interaction of ϕAI and AI investment are not simply reflecting sources of
unobserved heterogeneity that would be correlated with broader technology investment, such as
financial resources, free cash flow, or overall digital intensity. Figure 6b performs a similar comparison
but uses AI investment for all interactions and alters the decentralization measure. It includes ϕAI
but it also adds measures constructed in similar ways for ϕN ET and ϕCLOU D . We only observe
correlations with market value when AI investment is accompanied by ϕAI .
 In a final test, Figure 6c returns to the original construction of ϕAI but adds a parallel measure
using occupations where decision-making is lowest in its importance. This comparison shows that the
market value correlations are stronger for occupations where decision-making is important. In sum,
Figure 6 indicates that correlations with market value only appear at the confluence of AI investment
and AI skills among domain experts engaged in decision-making. Although we should be cautious
before interpreting this relationship causally, these results do suggest that investments in algorithms
and the workers who can apply them to meet business goals are disproportionately accumulating
in high value firms. Similar patterns of resource accumulation do not exist for other technologies or
skills or for employees who are not instrumental to the firm’s decision-making processes.
 The robustness tests presented in this section are supportive of the argument that the comple-
mentarity between AI investment and decentralized expertise is not merely a reflection of broader
technological sophistication or financial resources - it represents an organizational asset that cre-
ates value. This suggests managers should focus on building AI capabilities among domain experts
within a more general digital transformation strategy. Second, the stronger effects found in larger
firms highlight unique challenges based on organizational scale. Larger organizations may need to be
more intentional about fostering AI capabilities across business units, but they also stand to gain
more from successful implementation. Third, the evolution from data science to AI investments

 22

indicates that organizations need to stay attuned to technological shifts and adapt their workforce
development accordingly.

6 Managerial and Theoretical Implications
Adoption of algorithmic decision-making, and particularly predictive AI applications, has been dif-
ficult and uneven (Zolas et al., 2021). The evidence from this analysis suggests that the human
capital of data-driven firms differs from that of firms that lag in this domain. This implies firms face
considerable adjustment costs when adopting these technologies, which in turn suggests competitive
rents for firms that have successfully found the right mix of workers.
 A caveat is that the costs of using AI and data science technologies are rapidly falling. Conver-
sational interfaces driven by generative AI, for instance, represent a shift in how knowledge workers
interact with information technologies, making them more accessible and easier to learn than ever. A
reduction in the costs of using these tools means that employers can more easily push data analysis
tasks to domain experts. The implications of this shift for managers can be significant. For managers,
no-code and generative AI tools can democratize technical skill, enabling a more diverse range of
employees to contribute to areas that were once the exclusive domain of technical specialists. This
can lead to more innovative environments that emphasize the productive combination of human
creativity and computational power. Managers, in turn, may need to adapt by focusing less on
specific technical skills when hiring and more on general problem-solving abilities and adaptability.
 An emerging managerial challenge is that technical skill has economic attributes that dif-
ferentiate it from other types of expertise. For instance, frontier technical skills derive significant
productivity benefits from geographic agglomeration. Moreover, rapid technological depreciation
changes the economics of professions in which technical human capital plays an important role,
which has implications for topics like gender-based equity and skilled immigration that routinely
attract scrutiny from legislators and managers. Given these dynamics, cultivating a learning culture
within organizations becomes crucial. As algorithmic technologies evolve, firms need to continu-
ously invest in upskilling their workforce, particularly for domain experts who must stay current
with emerging tools while maintaining their core expertise. Organizations that can create effective
learning environments and provide ongoing training opportunities are likely to be better positioned
to capitalize on algorithmic advances. The challenge for managers is not just providing technical
training, but fostering an environment where domain experts feel empowered to experiment with
new tools and approaches.
 From an organizational perspective, firms need structures that facilitate collaboration between
domain experts and technical specialists while carefully considering decision-making processes as
domain experts become increasingly proficient with data and algorithms. This might involve cre-
ating cross-functional teams and communities of practice for knowledge sharing, while adapting
traditional hierarchical processes to account for domain experts who now have both subject matter
expertise and technical capabilities. The challenge is creating structures and governance mechanisms

 23

---

that maintain necessary specialization and oversight while enabling the productive combination of
expertise. This may require new review processes for algorithmic decisions, clear guidelines for when
human judgment should override algorithms, and new metrics for evaluating data-driven decisions.
The goal should be to create organizational and decision-making structures that capitalize on the
unique combination of domain and technical expertise while maintaining accountability.
 Finally, for educators, the falling costs of technical skill acquisition associated with no-code
and generative AI technologies suggest the need for a curricular reorientation. Although technical
skills will remain important for specialized workers in IT occupations, there may be greater emphasis
from non-technical workers on understanding how to effectively interact with AI tools, interpret their
output, and apply critical thinking to leverage AI-generated content. Educators will need to focus
on educating students about how to guide and evaluate AI output. The results in this study suggest
that this type of education will be required for all majors, not just technical majors. Institutions
that have not traditionally been focused on providing technical skills to students, such as business
schools, have observed a surge in interest in demand for courses teaching data, analytics, and AI
technologies (Eisenmann, 2013; Lohr, 2017; Guetta and Griffel, 2021; Becker, 2023). These findings
suggest these changes may be an appropriate response to a labor market that will increasingly
demand workers with both domain expertise and algorithmic skills.

7 Conclusions
This paper provides evidence from two data sources that expertise with algorithmic technologies
is becoming dispersed among domain experts in organizations at the technical frontier and that
these workforce changes produce value. It documents one early but important facet of the workforce
transformation occurring to support the use of algorithms in organizations.
 There are several important limitations of this analysis. The study provides limited visibility
into the precise nature of expertise required by workers and focuses on the narrow question of how
specific skills are bundled together into jobs. The data does not distinguish between deep technolog-
ical expertise and interactional expertise. The latter may be sufficient for engaging with developers
and builders of these tools, but may not be enough to be effective when using these technologies.
Furthermore, questions remain about how to restructure decisions around algorithms and where
firms should place oversight of algorithmic decisions. Moreover, this study does not investigate the
organizational structures and processes that firms may need to implement to effectively leverage
these workers, which is an important area for future research. The analysis also takes a static view
of technology adoption, not capturing long-term labor market consequences. Finally, more time is
needed for firms to adapt to this new mode of production to gather stronger causal evidence of the
impact of these workforce changes on performance.
 There is significant scope for future work in this area. Research about the coming wave of
investment in algorithmic technologies, and the work practices that will be required to accompany
these changes, is in its infancy. We have much to learn about how to design organizations so that

 24

humans can effectively work with algorithms. This paper considers one facet of workforce transfor-
mation but complements to algorithmic technologies will be wide-ranging. These will likely include
even more sweeping changes to workforce skills, as well as other non-labor investments to support
these capabilities.
 Indeed, a key limitation of this paper, like much of the research on technology and work,
is that it takes a static view. At this early stage, there is limited evidence that the use of these
technologies has had broad labor market consequences. Stronger causal evidence of the impact of
these workforce changes on performance requires allowing firms more time to adapt to this new
mode of production. Additionally, new technologies for data collection, analysis, prediction, and
visualization will offer improved capabilities to generate insights. As this frontier advances, it will
continue to change markets for these skills, and continue to raise new questions about how employers
should integrate algorithms into their work.

 (b) Marginal effects of algorithmic and domain expertise (joint) on different data tasks

Figure notes: Figure (a) depicts correlations between skills needed on-the-job and algorithmic expertise in the job listings from
January 2016. Each vertical bar is a coefficient estimate from a separate regression of the form SKILLi = αALG ALGi +
αDAT A DAT Ai + αN ET N ETi + Log(N o. Skills)i + γi + ϕi + ϵi where for each of the five different regressions, SKILL is one
of DOMAIN, COGNITIVE, SOCIAL, CHARACTER, or MANAGEMENT, i indexes the listing, γ and ϕ are occupation and
industry fixed-effects respectively, and Log(N o. Skills) is the logged number of skills in the listing. The point estimate shown
is the coefficient on αALG from each regression and the vertical bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The estimates from
the full form of each of these regressions is shown in Appendix C. Figure (b) reports results from tests of which data tasks
require a combination of both algorithmic and domain expertise using the January 2016 job listings. The logistic regression is
DAT AT ASKi = βDA (DOMi × ALGi ) + βD DOMi + βA ALGi + Log(N o. Skills)i + ϵi where DOMi and ALGi are binary
variables indicating that a listing requires domain or algorithmic expertise and the data tasks can be one of either Data
management, Data modeling, Data visualization, Decision making, Data analytics, or Presentation. The point estimate that is
presented is the marginal effect of the βDA coefficient. Standard error bars show the 95% confidence interval.

A Description of corporate workforce data
This section discusses the Revelio corporate workforce data and presents comparisons with data sets with
known sampling properties. This comparison is intended to discuss any limitations that sampling restrictions
might impose on the main estimates. To evaluate coverage in these data, comparisons of the workforce data
are presented with three different data sources: i) the distribution of US workers across occupations reported
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), ii) the distribution of employment by NAICS industry, and iii) how
employment is distributed across US states.

A.1 Data generating process and sampling frame
Revelio is a workforce intelligence company that federates data across a range of Internet sources including
federal databases, professional networking sites, and job posting aggregators. This analysis relies on their
workforce, position, and skill databases which contain data on the movements of an extremely large sample
of US-based employees across firms, the job titles they hold, and the skills they acquire. Data on employment
spells, at scale, are not otherwise collected by government agencies. They are only available through resume
banks so these types of data are particularly useful for studying quantities of workers in firms with different
skills and the flow of workers of different types between organizations.
 On the other hand, there are some potential issues when using data sources of this type. Workers par-
ticipate on professional networking sites unevenly. Moreover, workers can be selective about what information
they include on these sites and what information they omit. These choices generate measurement error when
these data sources are being used to understand a firm’s skills or occupations. Prior work discusses some of
these considerations (Horton and Tambe, 2015) but the following sections calibrate specific strengths and
deficiencies in terms of coverage. Measurement error in this data set is discussed later in this appendix.

A.2 BLS-SOC share comparisons
The distribution of Revelio workers across occupations is shown in Figure A.1a. Figure A.1b presents dif-
ferences in shares of the major occupational groups as reported by the BLS and represented in the Revelio
data, where the assignment of workers to SOC areas in the Revelio data is provided by Revelio. The blue
line indicates no (zero) difference in shares such that bars to the right (left) are those occupations where the
occupation accounts for a higher (lower) proportion of workers in the BLS data than the Revelio data.
 From this comparison, we can see that “white-collar”, knowledge-intensive occupations like manage-
ment and Information Technology work tend to be over represented in the Revelio data set whereas front-line
occupations in sectors like manufacturing, production, and transportation are underrepresented. This is not
a surprise given that these data are gathered from professional networking sites on which white-collar workers
tend to be over represented. The length of each bar is the difference in shares across these data sources. The
largest imbalance in occupations in Management. The difference in the share of total workers that managers
account for in the Revelio data set (15%) and the BLS (7%) is about 8% percentage points.

A.3 NAICS Industry comparisons
Employment comparisons at the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry level are
reported in Figures A.1c and A.1d. These industry level comparisons are conducted at the 2-digit NAICS level
where the underlying allocation of workers across industries is taken from the Occupational Employment Sur-
vey data. Industry classifications in the Revelio data are generated by assigning employers to industries and
like the occupational assignments, are directly reported by Revelio for each employee. The share differences
we can observe in this comparison are consistent with the earlier observation that white-collar professions
are over-represented in the Revelio data set. Technology, finance, professional services, and manufacturing
industries account for larger shares of employees in the Revelio data than they do in the BLS data. By
comparison, healthcare and construction account for smaller shares.

 38

---

A.4 Geographic (state) comparison
A final comparison, shown in the bottom panel (Figures A.1e and A.1f) is state-level comparisons. This
comparison evaluates the reported geographic location of workers in the Revelio data set with the distribution
of workers across US states. Unsurprisingly, we can see that states with significant industry representation
for finance and technology (such as New York) account for a relatively larger share of workers in the Revelio
data. The largest imbalance is in North Dakota, where industries like oil extraction and agriculture play a
larger role in the state economy.

A.5 Discussion
In sum, when we consider the spread of algorithmic technologies into occupations, industries, and geographies,
workers in the Revelio data set are likely to be over-representative of those information-intensive industries,
occupations, and sectors that are likely to be most impacted by these technological changes.
 Having greater quantities of workers in this database from some sectors and occupations will affect
the precision of the measurement, but this may fall into under normal, random measurement error if those
workers who do report their skills are not very different from the ones who do. The number of workers in the
database from each Fortune 500 firm is large though. Even in underrepresented occupations and industries,
the database should produce a high-quality signal of the skill content of a profession.
 A less innocuous issue is that the reporting of skills themselves may be inconsistent. Workers in some
occupations and industries may be more inclined to report these skills on their profiles. They may consistently
report skills that are likely to lead to future employment opportunities, but inconsistently report skills that
the market does not deem to be particularly valuable. This can impact the interpretation of the magnitudes
of the coefficients in the main regressions (e.g. market return to an additional database engineer), although
it should not impact the sign and direction of these estimates.

Notes: These three figures illustrate the difference in compositional shares between the Revelio and BLS data sets. The top
row is comparison of occupations. The second row is comparison across NAICS industries. The third row is comparisons across
states. The length of each bar for plots in the second column is computed as the difference in the share that the worker category
accounts for in the Revelio data and in the administrative data. For instance, Management workers comprise 15% of the Revelio
data set and 7% of the BLS data set so the length of the bar indicates an 8% difference between the two.

B Categorizing skills into technological areas
A key measurement task for this analysis is to generate a taxonomy of skills, either as embedded in job
listings or reported by employees on their profiles, that enables measurement of technological expertise. This
requires construction of a mapping from granular skills to the broader technological areas to which they
are related. For instance, skills such as “Oracle DB” and “MySQL” both indicate expertise with relational
database technologies. To construct this taxonomy in the workforce data, I leverage an existing structure from
Revelio that categorizes skills into technological groups. This data provider uses data clustering techniques to
categorize skills into a taxonomy. This approach combines skills into common groups if they inhabit a similar
area of the skill landscape after clustering. The ensuing technological clusters are then assigned labels by the
provider. The skills that appear in each of the key technology categories, as constructed by the data provider,
are shown below. It is important to note that each of the skills shown below are one of 1,500 keyword skill
categories that contain sub-skills within them. For instance, ’machine learning’ may include skills within it
like ’classification’, ’clustering’, or ’deep learning’. The skill name itself is not an indicator of a hierarchy.
For instance, the ’Tableau’ category also contains ’Microsoft BI’ and ’Qlik’, which are competitor no-code
tools. Therefore, each of the technological areas shown below is a mapping of categories which themselves
are a grouping of keywords.
 Skills in the job listings data are organized under a separate taxonomy. However, to maintain con-
sistency across the analysis, I harmonize the skills in the job listings data with the technological categories
included in the workforce intelligence data. For instance, an ’Algorithms’ category was created from the job
listings data by identifying skills in the job listings that had a match with one of the skills in the equivalent
category in the workforce data. Matches were made manually, to account for minor differences in case or
how skill names were standardized by the different providers.

C Full correlation table between technologies and job skills
In this section, we present a fuller discussion for some of table results discussed in an abbreviated manner
in the main text. Table C.1 presents results corresponding to the coefficient estimates depicted in Figure 4.
The table reports results from the full form of the regression which is:

 AT T Ri = βA ALGi + βD DATi + βN N ETi + γi + ϵi

Figure 4 in the main text shows that algorithmic skill is correlated with domain expertise and cognitive skill.
There are negative correlations with Character and Management, after conditioning on job title and industry.
The regression also includes measures of skills related to databases (DATA) and network administration
(NET). Database management is negatively correlated with all dependent variables which is probably a
by-product of the skill-intensive nature of that position. Network administration exhibits relatively weak
correlations with all of these job attributes.

 Table notes: This table reports results from the logit regression AT T Ri = βA ALGi + βD DATi + βN N ETi + γi + ϵi . It
 estimates conditional correlations between algorithmic expertise and other job attributes. Log(N o.of skills) is the log of
 the total number of skills in the job ad. The dependent variable indicates whether or not a job listing requires knowledge of
 an application domain, social skills, character, cognitive skills, and people management skills, respectively. All regressions
 include job title and industry fixed-effects (NAICS 4). Standard errors are shown in parentheses. ∗∗∗ p<.01, ∗∗ p<.05,
