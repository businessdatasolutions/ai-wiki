                                         ABSTRACT
                                         Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a
                                         challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
                                         achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where
                                         LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and
                                         provide scalable and flexible assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven
                                         evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge
                                         that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on LLM-as-a-
                                         Judge, offering a formal definition and a detailed classification, while focusing on addressing the core
                                         question: How to built reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems? We explore strategies to enhance reliability,
                                         including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally,
                                         we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel
                                         benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-
                                         Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions.
                                            This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.
                                         Our contributions span multiple levels: we establish the conceptual boundaries of LLM-as-a-Judge, reorganize
                                         fragmented literature into a unified framework, and propose a novel reliability-oriented benchmark. Building
                                         on these, we also articulate a forward-looking research agenda, offering both theoretical foundations and
                                         practical guidance for constructing reliable and socially trustworthy LLM-as-a-Judge systems. The associated

1   INTRODUCTION
       Judgment is the faculty of thinking the particular as contained under the universal. It
       involves the capacity to subsume under rules, that is, to distinguish whether something
       falls under a given rule.
                 —— Kant, Critique of Judgment [59], Introduction IV, 5:179; Critique of Pure Reason [58], A132/B171.
   Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across numerous
domains [178], ranging from technical fields [142, 191, 210] to the humanities [55, 100, 113, 217]
and social sciences [45, 127, 164, 177]. This growing interest stems from LLMs’ ability to mimic
human-like reasoning and thinking processes, enabling them to take on roles traditionally reserved
for human experts while offering a cost-effective solution that can be effortlessly scaled to meet
increasing evaluation demands. For instance, the use of LLM-as-a-Judge in academic peer review1
offers a potential means to address the sharp growth in submissions while sustaining expert-level
judgments.
   Before the era of LLMs, finding a balance between comprehensive and scalable evaluation
posed a persistent challenge. On the one hand, widely used subjective methods like expert-driven
assessments [38, 126] integrate holistic reasoning and fine-grained contextual understanding,
making them the gold standard in comprehensiveness. However, these approaches are costly,
difficult to scale, and susceptible to inconsistency. On the other hand, objective assessment methods,
such as automatic metrics, offer strong scalability and consistency. For example, tools such as
BLEU [109] or ROUGE [85] can rapidly evaluate machine-generated translations or summaries
against reference texts without human intervention. However, these metrics, which heavily rely on
surface-level lexical overlaps, often fail to capture deeper nuances, resulting in poor performance
in tasks like story generation or instructional texts [122]. As a solution to this persistent dilemma,
“LLM-as-a-Judge” has emerged as a promising idea to combine the strengths of the above two
evaluation methods. Recent studies have shown that this idea can merge the scalability of automatic
methods with the detailed, context-sensitive reasoning found in expert judgments [18, 79, 162, 213,
222]. Moreover, LLMs may become sufficiently flexible to handle multimodal inputs [17] under
appropriate prompt learning or fine-tuning [62]. These advantages suggest that the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach could serve as a novel and broadly applicable paradigm for addressing complex and
open-ended evaluation problems.
   LLM-as-a-Judge holds significant potential as a scalable and adaptable evaluation framework
compared to the aforementioned two traditional methods [158]. However, its widespread adoption is
hindered by two key challenges. The first challenge lies in the absence of a systematic review, which
highlights the lack of formal definitions, fragmented understanding, and inconsistent usage practices
in the relevant studies. As a result, researchers and practitioners struggle to fully understand and
apply effectively. The second challenge concerns reliability [189], as merely employing LLM-as-a-
Judge does not ensure accurate evaluations aligned with established standards. These challenges
emphasize the need for a deeper assessment of the outputs generated by LLM-as-a-Judge, as well
as a crucial investigation into the question: How to build reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems?
   To address these challenges, this paper provides a systematic review of research on LLM-as-a-
Judge. It offers a comprehensive overview of the field and explores strategies for building reliable
LLM-as-a-Judge systems. We begin by defining LLM-as-a-Judge through both formal and informal
definitions, answering the foundational question: "What is LLM-as-a-Judge?" Next, we categorize
existing methods and approaches, exploring "How to use LLM-as-a-Judge?". Following this, to tackle
the critical question: "How to build reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems?", we explore two core aspects:
(1) strategies to enhance the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems and (2) methodologies for

evaluating the reliability of these systems. For the first aspect, we review key strategies to optimize
the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge. For the second aspect, we examine the metrics, datasets, and
methodologies used to evaluate LLM-as-a-Judge systems, highlighting potential sources of bias
and methods for their mitigation. Building on this, we introduce a novel benchmark specifically
designed for evaluating LLM-as-a-Judge systems. Finally, we discuss future research directions,
emphasizing key areas for improving reliability, scalability, and applicability. The contributions of
this study can be summarized as follows:
   (1) At the definitional level, we establish both formal and informal definitions of LLM-as-a-
       Judge, thereby delineating the conceptual boundaries of this emerging paradigm. We also
       introduce a contextualized definition of reliability, which incorporates input variability, model
       characteristics, and contextual dependencies, providing a principled foundation for theorizing
       and building reliable systems.
   (2) At the framework level, we conduct a systematic reorganization of fragmented literature
       into a unified conceptual structure. Specifically, we map prior work to four foundational
       questions: what it is, how to use it, how to improve it, and how to evaluate it—framing
       reliability as the unifying thread across these dimensions.
   (3) At the empirical level, we perform comparative analyses of existing approaches and further
       propose a meta-evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating LLM-as-a-Judge
       systems. This benchmark facilitates systematic reliability assessment, uncovering key trade-
       offs such as robustness versus sensitivity, and offering actionable insights for constructing
       trustworthy evaluation frameworks.
   (4) At the perspective level, we offer a comprehensive analysis that integrates the applications,
       challenges, and future directions of LLM-as-a-Judge, providing a roadmap that extends beyond
       the scope of existing surveys. By systematically reviewing its applications in core machine
       learning and high-stakes domains, we identify domain-specific reliability requirements and
       underexplored challenges such as meta-evaluation and long-term consistency. Building
       on these findings, we articulate a forward-looking agenda that emphasizes theoretically
       grounded methodologies, systematic benchmarks, and hybrid human–AI frameworks for
       constructing reliable and socially trustworthy systems.
   The rest of this survey is organized as Figure 1. Specifically, Section 2 provides an overview of the
LLM-as-a-Judge field, including its definitions and categorization of existing methods. For a quick
guide on the implementation of an LLM as a judge for specific scenarios, you can find answers
in Quick Practice (2.5). Strategies for enhancing and evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge
systems are discussed in Sections 3 and 4 respectively. Notably, in Section 7.1, we discuss the
synergy between LLM-as-a-Judge and Reasoning-Centric enhancement, where dynamic feedback
is used to optimize reasoning paths and significantly improve the model’s ability to solve complex
problems. Section 5 explores practical applications, while Sections 6 and 7 address challenges and
outline future research directions. Finally, Section 8 presents our conclusions.

2   BACKGROUND AND METHOD
The capacity of LLMs to emulate human reasoning and evaluate specific inputs against a set of
predefined rules has paved the way for "LLM-as-a-Judge." Existing studies indicate that LLM’s
scalability, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness make them well-suited for a growing number of
evaluative tasks that were traditionally done by humans. These abilities are key in utilizing LLMs
flexibly across various evaluation scenarios and objectives. As a result, the adoption of LLM in
evaluation has progressed rapidly in practice. Initially, the primary focus of LLMs was on language
generation and comprehension. With advancements in training paradigms like Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [108], LLMs became increasingly aligned with human
values and reasoning processes. This alignment has allowed LLMs to transition from generative
tasks to evaluation. At its core, LLM-as-a-Judge denotes the use of LLMs to evaluate objects, actions,
or decisions based on predefined rules, criteria, or preferences. It encompasses a broad spectrum
of roles, including: Graders [28, 150], Evaluators/Assessors [80, 197], Critics [61, 111, 174],
Verifiers [88, 128, 165], Examiners [8], Reward/Ranking Models [98, 136, 179, 193], etc.
   Currently, the definition of how to effectively use LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation tasks is largely
informal or vague, lacking a clear and formal expression. Therefore, we will start with a formal
definition of LLM-as-a-Judge as follows:

                                                  E ← PL L M (𝑥 ⊕ C)
     • E: The final evaluation obtained from the whole LLM-as-a-Judge process in the expected
       manner. It could be a score, a choice, a label or a sentence, etc.
     • PL L M : The probability function defined by the corresponding LLM, and the generation is
       an auto-regressive process.
     • 𝑥: The input data in any available types (text, image, video), which waiting to be evaluated.
     • C: The context for the input 𝑥, which is often prompt template or combined with history
       information in dialogue.
     • ⊕: The combination operator combines the input 𝑥 with the context C, and this operation
       can vary depending on the context, such as being placed at the beginning, middle, or end.
   The formulation of LLM-as-a-Judge reflects that LLM is a type of auto-regressive generative
model, which generates subsequent content based on the context to obtain target evaluation. It
illustrates how we utilize LLM for evaluation tasks, encompassing input design, model selection, and
training, as well as output post-processing. The basic approaches of implementing LLM-as-a-Judge
can be classified by the formulation: In-Context Learning, Model Selection, Post-processing Method,
and Evaluation Pipeline in Figure 2. By following this pipeline, one can build a basic LLM-as-a-Judge
for evaluation. A quick practice guide is available in section 2.5. However, the basic definition alone
does not guarantee the reliability of evaluations. To explicitly highlight and address reliability, we
further propose the following enhanced formal definition:
                                                 R ← 𝑓R (PL L M , 𝑥, C)

     • R: The evaluation explicitly designed to ensure consistency, robustness, and alignment with
       human judgment. This reliability is verified through additional validation, calibration, and
       standardization steps beyond the basic pipeline.

      • 𝑓R : A series of constraints and validation methods applied systematically to the basic LLM-
        as-a-Judge framework to enhance evaluation reliability. These include methods to mitigate
        biases, control variability, and confirm robustness against adversarial inputs.


2.1     In-Context Learning
To apply LLM-as-a-Judge, evaluation tasks are typically specified using In-Context Learning meth-
ods, which provide instructions and examples to guide the model’s reasoning and judgment. This
process involves two key aspects: input design and prompt design. For input design, it is important
to consider the type of variables to be evaluated (such as text, image, or video), the manner of input
(e.g., individually, in pairs, or in batches), and its position (e.g., at the beginning, middle, or end).
For the prompt design, four different methods can be adopted, as illustrated in Figure 2. These
methods include generating scores, solving true/false questions, conducting pairwise comparisons,
and making multiple-choice selections. Further details will be presented in the following sections.

2.1.1 Generating scores. It is quite intuitive to represent an evaluation using a corresponding
score, shown in Figure 3. What requires more careful consideration, however, is the nature and
range of the score used for evaluation. The score can be discrete, with common ranges like 1-3,
1-5 [56], or 1-10 [79, 222]. Alternatively, it can be continuous, ranging from 0 to 1 or 0 to 100 [174].
The simplest way to score is through the context, setting the range of scores and the main criteria
for scoring. For example, "Please rate the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, level of details of their
responses. Each assistant receives an overall score on a scale of 1 to 10, where a higher score indicates
better overall performance" [222]. A slightly more complex way is to provide more detailed scoring
criteria. More complex scoring situations can be as Language-Model-as-an-Examiner [8], which
use Likert scale scoring functions as an absolute evaluative measure. The evaluator assigns scores
to a given response along predefined dimensions, including accuracy, coherence, factuality, and
comprehensiveness. Each of these dimensions is scored on a scale of 1 to 3, ranging from worst to
best. The evaluator is also asked to provide an overall score ranging from 1 to 5, based on the scores
assigned to the previous 4 dimensions. This score serves as an indicator of the overall quality of
the answer.

     Likert Scale Scoring:
     Evaluate the quality of summaries written for a news article. Rate each summary on four
     dimensions: {Dimension_1}, {Dimension_2}, {Dimension_3}, and {Dimension_4}. You should
     rate on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).

     Summary: {Summary}
     Pairwise Comparison:
     Given a new article, which summary is better? Answer "Summary 0" or "Summary 1". You
     do not need to explain the reason.
     Article: {Article}
     Summary 0: {Summary_0}
     Summary 1: {Summary_1}

2.1.2 Solving Yes/No questions. A Yes/No question requires a judgment on a given statement,
focusing solely on its accuracy. This type of question is simple and direct, providing only two fixed
responses—yes or no, true or false—without any additional comparisons or choices.
   This type of evaluation is often utilized in intermediate processes, creating the conditions for a
feedback loop. For example, it promotes a self-optimization cycle, as seen in Reflexion [128], which
generates verbal self-reflections to provide valuable feedback for future attempts. In scenarios with
sparse reward signals, such as a binary success status (success/fail), the self-reflection model uses
the current trajectory and persistent memory to generate nuanced and specific feedback. Similarly,
in self-improvement contexts [145], Yes/No questions can be employed to evaluate custom phrases,
such as "Modification needed." and "No modification needed.", facilitating entry into the
next cycle. Moreover, these evaluations are common for testing knowledge accuracy and assessing
whether statements align with established facts [135], like "Given a question and the associated
retrieved knowledge graph triples (entity, relation, entity), you are asked to answer whether it’s
sufficient for you to answer the question with these triples and your knowledge (Yes or No)." A
detailed and specific example can be seen in the Figure 4.

2.1.3 Conducting pairwise comparisons. Pairwise comparison refers to comparing two options
and selecting which one is superior or more aligned with a specific standard, showed in Figure 4. It
involves making a decision between two options rather than judgement between ’yes’ or ’no’. The
comparison can be subjective or based on objective criteria. This evaluation is a relative evaluation.
Pairwise comparison is often used for ranking multiple options or prioritizing them, where several
comparisons are made between pairs to identify the better choice or establish a hierarchy.
   Pairwise comparison is a well-established method that has significantly impacted a variety of
fields [112]. As noted by [95], LLM and human evaluations are more aligned in the context of
pairwise comparisons compared to score-based assessments. Numerous studies have demonstrated
that pairwise comparative assessments outperform other judging methods in terms of positional
consistency [96, 213]. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons can be extended to more complex relation-
based assessment frameworks, such as list-wise comparisons, using advanced ranking algorithms

                                                                            , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.

[95, 112], data filtering [193]. In pairwise comparative assessments, LLM-as-a-Judge is prompted to
select the response that better answers the question at hand. To accommodate the possibility of
a tie, several option modes are introduced. The Two-Option mode requires judges to choose the
better response from two given options. The Three-Option mode introduces an additional choice,
allowing judges to indicate a tie if neither response is preferable, as shown in Figure 4. Evaluations
typically involve determining the outcomes of win, tie, or loss for responses [162] through pairwise
comparisons, with win rounds counted for each response. The Four-Option mode further expands
the choices, allowing judges to classify responses as either a "both good tie" or a "both bad tie."
2.1.4 Making multiple-choice selections. Multiple-choice selections involve providing several
options, not giving relative choices in pairwise comparison, nor making a yes/no judgment. The
evaluator must choose the most appropriate or correct one. This method allows for a broader range
of responses compared to true/false questions and can assess deeper understanding or preferences.
However, this kind of prompt design is more rare than the first three.

      Reliability Concerns of In-Context Learning

      When leveraging in-context learning, certain issues can surface, potentially impacting
      the reliability of evaluations. These include the variability of LLM outputs due to minor
      prompt changes, which can lead to unstable results. Furthermore, score-based assessments
      often exhibit inconsistent inter-rater reliability, influenced by the inherent randomness of
      LLM generation and its sensitivity to phrasing. Similarly, evaluation formats like Yes/No
      or multiple-choice questions are prone to ambiguity in response interpretation. Lastly,
      LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations may inadvertently reflect biases, such as favoring responses
      based on their position or length.


2.2     Model Selection
2.2.1 General LLM. To automate evaluation by LLM-as-a-Judge, one effective approach is to
employ advanced language models such as GPT-4 [107] instead of human evaluators [213]. For
instance, Li et al. [81] created a test set with 805 questions and assessed the performance by
comparing it to text-davinci-003 using GPT-4. Additionally, Zheng et al. [213] designed 80 multi-
round test questions across eight common areas and used GPT-4 to automatically score the model’s
responses. The accuracy of the GPT-4-based evaluator has been demonstrated to be high compared
to professional human evaluators, showing superior consistency and stability in evaluations. At the
same time, if the general LLM used has limitations in instruction-following or reasoning abilities,
the effectiveness of the LLM-as-a-Judge method may be significantly affected.
2.2.2 Fine-tuned LLM. However, relying on external API for evaluation may introduce con-
sideration about privacy leakage, and the opacity of API models also challenges the evaluation
reproducibility. Therefore, subsequent studies recommend refining language models tailored for
evaluations by emphasizing the use of pairwise comparisons or grading. For instance, PandaLM
[162] constructs data based on Alpaca instructions and GPT-3.5 annotation, and then fine-tunes
LLaMA-7B [147] as an evaluator model. JudgeLM [222] constructs data from diversified instruction
sets and GPT-4 annotations, and fine-tunes Vicuna [148] as a scalable evaluator model. Auto-J
[79] constructs evaluation data upon multiple scenarios to train a generative evaluator model,
which can provide both evaluation and critical opinion. Prometheus [63] defines thousands of
evaluation criteria and constructs a feedback dataset based on GPT-4, and fine-tunes a fine-grained
evaluator model. The typical process for fine-tuning a judge model involves three main steps. Step

A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


1: Data Collection. The training data generally consists of three components: instructions, the
objects to be evaluated, and evaluations. Instructions are typically sourced from instruction datasets,
while evaluations can come from either GPT-4 or human annotations. Step 2-Prompt Design.
The structure of the prompt template can vary based on the evaluation scheme, which already
detailed in § 2.1. Step 3: Model Fine-Tuning. Using the designed prompts and collected data,
the fine-tuning process for the evaluator model typically adheres to the instruction fine-tuning
paradigm [108]. The model receives an instruction along with one or more responses to generate
output that includes evaluation results and possibly explanations.
   After fine-tuning, the evaluator model can be employed to evaluate the target object. While
these fine-tuned models often demonstrate superior performance on self-designed test sets, they
are identified several limitations in their evaluation capabilities,which detailed in Section 4.2.
The current prompt and fine-tuning dataset designs often result in evaluation LLMs with poor
generalization, making them difficult to compare with strong LLMs like GPT-4.

      Reliability Concerns of Model Selection

      The choice of model significantly impacts the dependability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems.
      Concerns arise from the black-box nature and version dependency of general-purpose
      LLMs, which can hinder the reproducibility of evaluation outputs. Fine-tuned evaluators,
      while specialized, often exhibit overfitting and limited generalization beyond their training
      data. Moreover, these models can inherit subtle biases from their training datasets, necessi-
      tating careful meta-evaluation to ensure fairness. Finally, reliance on smaller open-source
      models, while cost-effective, may introduce inconsistencies and misalignment with human
      judgments.


2.3    Post-processing
Post-processing refines the probability distributions generated by LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure accu-
rate evaluations. The evaluation format should align with our In-Context Learning design and may
involve procedures to enhance the reliability of extracted evaluations, which should be applied
consistently. We focus on three main post-processing methods: extracting specific tokens, normal-
izing the output logits, and selecting sentences with high returns. However, it is important to note
that each method has significant limitations when evaluating objective questions. For example, in
text response evaluation [189], failing to accurately extract the key answer token from the LLM’s
response can result in incorrect evaluation outcomes. These challenges in post-processing are
tightly linked to the prompt design used in earlier ICL stages and the selected model’s ability to
follow instructions reliably.
2.3.1 Extracting specific tokens. As showed in In-context Learning (Section 2.1), when the
evaluation target take the form of a score, selecting specific options, or responding with Yes/No,
applying rule-match to extract the corresponding token from the response generated during
probability distribution iteration is common used. It is worth noting that Yes/No is a broad definition,
including custom statements involving judgment. Considering a Yes/No question for evaluation in
custom phrases [145]: "Modification needed." and "No modification needed." or a yes-no
question "Does the above answer need to be further modified?". When the input sample
is put through the template, it might have outputs such as "Modification needed.", "Conclusion:
Modification needed." or "Yes". This variance in response formats is difficult to parse consistently.
The corresponding post-processing with the response is necessary. Using rules to extract specific
tokens for our designed prompts and input content, as well as the backbone model used for the

                                                         , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
                                                                                  J. Gu, X. Jiang, Z. Shi, J. Guo, et al.


evaluator, all have higher requirements as we discussed in Section 2.2. In contextual learning, if
there is no clear indication of the output format for response, there may be various expressions of
evaluation, which can be seen in Figure 2. For example, "Response 1 is better" and "The better one
is response 1", which convey the same choice but differ in format leading to the difficulty of rule
recognition. Simple solutions often involve providing clear instructions, such as "The last sentence
should be started with ’The better response is’", or using a few-shot strategy. Also, the general
model with insufficient instruction following capability may not be able to generate the evaluation
format and content of the target according to the instruction, resulting in the post-processing
extracted according to the rules not as smooth as expected.
   Constrained decoding is a technique that enforces structured output from Large Language Models
(LLMs) by restricting token generation according to predefined schemas, typically in formats like
JSON. This approach uses a finite state machine (FSM) to compute valid next tokens at each decoding
step, effectively masking the model’s output probability distribution to ensure conformity with
the desired schema. While this method guarantees syntactically valid outputs, it presents several
challenges: it can distort the model’s learned distribution and potentially degrade output quality,
requires significant engineering implementation effort, and introduces computational overhead
during inference.
   Recent work has proposed various solutions to address these challenges. [11] introduces DOMINO,
a decoding algorithm that preserves natural tokenization while enforcing constraints. Their system
minimizes overhead through precomputation and speculative decoding, sometimes achieving faster
performance than unconstrained decoding. [29] develops XGrammar, which accelerates grammar-
constrained generation by separating tokens into those that can be pre-checked and those requiring
runtime verification. By co-designing the grammar engine with LLM inference, they achieve up
to 100x speedup over existing approaches.[215] presents SGLang, combining a domain-specific
language with an optimized runtime. Their system features efficient KV cache reuse and compressed
finite state machines for faster decoding, demonstrating that thoughtful co-design of programming
model and runtime can minimize constrained decoding overhead.
2.3.2 Normalizing the output logits. LLM-as-a-Judge in the intermediate steps with Yes/No
setting often normalizes the output logits to obtain the evaluation in the form of a continuous
decimal between 0 and 1. This is also very common in agent methods and prompt-based optimization
methods [43, 165, 225]. For example, the self-consistency and self-reflection scores [165] within
one forward pass of MEvaluator , are effectively obtained by constructing a prompt [(𝑥 ⊕ C) , "Yes"]
and acquire the probability of each token conditioned on the previous tokens 𝑃 (𝑡𝑖 |𝑡 <𝑖 ). The auto-
regressive feature is leveraged, thus aggregate the probability of the relevant tokens to compute the
self-consistent score 𝜌 Self-consistency and self-reflection score 𝜌 Self-reflection . The final score is produced
by 𝜌 𝑗 = 𝜌 SC,𝑗 · 𝜌 SR,𝑗 .
                           𝜌SC       𝜌
                                    SR  (       Î                     Î
                                          𝜌 SC = 𝑡𝑖 ∈𝛼 𝑃 (𝑡𝑖 |𝑡 <𝑖 ) · 𝑡𝑖 ∈𝛽 𝑃 (𝑡𝑖 |𝑡 <𝑖 )
                        z }| { z}|{
                        (𝑥 ⊕ C) "Yes" ⇒         Î
                        −−−−−−−−−−−−−→    𝜌 SR = 𝑡𝑖 ∈"Yes" 𝑃 (𝑡𝑖 |𝑡 <𝑖 )
In addition, Self-evaluation [43] is also common using this method for LLM-as-a-Judge. It can be
helpful to let the LLM evaluate itself by asking, "Is this reasoning step correct?" and then reward it
based on the probability of the next word being "Yes."
2.3.3 Selecting sentences. In addition to selecting specific tokens and normalizing the output
logits, the content extracted by LLM-as-a-Judge may also be a sentence or paragraph. As showed
in Figure 2, agent for reasoning task [43], builds a reasoning tree by iteratively considering the
most promising reasoning steps (actions, sub-questions) by LLM-as-a-Judge.

      Reliability Concerns of Post-processing Method

      The post-processing steps applied to LLM outputs introduce their own set of reliability
      challenges. Rule-based token extraction methods are inherently brittle and susceptible
      to minor variations in responses, potentially leading to silent errors. While logit-based
      normalization offers probabilistic scoring, its effectiveness is highly dependent on precise
      prompt design and consistent model tokenization, where inconsistencies can introduce
      noise. Furthermore, methods focusing on sentence-level evaluation or response selection
      risk propagating biases if the scoring LLM is overly sensitive to stylistic rather than sub-
      stantive cues. Ultimately, all post-processing strategies remain vulnerable to adversarial
      manipulations designed to inflate evaluation scores without genuine content improvement.


2.4     Evaluation Pipeline
After completing the three processes, we obtain the final evaluation E. From input to output, these
steps collectively constitute the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation pipeline, as illustrated in Figure 2. This
pipeline is commonly applied in four scenarios: LLM-as-a-Judge for models, LLM-as-a-Judge for
data, LLM-as-a-Judge for agents, and LLM-as-a-Judge for reasoning or thinking.

2.4.1 LLM-as-a-Judge for Models. It is universally known that the best way to evaluate LLMs is
human judgment, but collecting human annotations can be costly, time-consuming, and laborious
[108, 213]. Using strong LLMs (usually closed-source ones, e.g., GPT-4, Claude, ChatGPT) as an
automated proxy for assessing LLMs has become a natural choice [218], as shown in Figure 2.
With appropriate prompt design, the quality of evaluation and agreement to human judgment
can be promising [32, 155, 207, 213]. However, the cost concern still exists when calling the APIs
of these proprietary models, especially when there is a frequent need for model validation on
large-scale data. Moreover, closed-source LLM-as-a-Judge leads to low reproducibility due to
potential changes in models behind the API. Some recent works have started to make attempts for
open-source alternatives. SelFee [186] collects generations, feedback, and revised generations from
ChatGPT and fine-tunes LLaMA models to build a critique model. Shepherd [159] trains a model
that can output critiques for single-response with the data of feedback from online communities
and human annotation. PandaLM [162] trains a model to conduct pairwise comparison for LLM
Instruction Tuning Optimization, and Zheng et al. [213] also fine-tune Vicuna [148] on a 20K
pairwise comparison dataset to explore the potential of open-source models as a more cost-friendly
proxy.

2.4.2 LLM-as-a-Judge for Data. Data annotation generally refers to the labeling or generating
of raw data with relevant information, which could be used for improving the efficacy of machine
learning models. The process, however, is labor-intensive and costly. The emergence of LLMs
presents an unprecedented opportunity to automate the complicated process of data annotation by
LLM-as-a-Judge. Most of the data need to be evaluated by LLM-as-a-Judge is generated by models,
or large-scale crawled data. Language models first conduct supervised fine-tuning to imitate how to
align with human instructions [143, 160]. After that, reinforcement learning techniques have been
explored to align language models with human preferences [108, 118]. The most successful way is
applying a RLHF framework [108] via training a reward model on human feedback and using PPO
[123] to obtain the policy model for language generation. However, in practices, the PPO training
paradigm is complex in coding and hyper-parameter tuning while it needs four models that are
hard for training. This motivates us to explore simpler and more straightforward methods to align
language models with human preferences. This involves how to use LLM-as-a-Judge to evaluate
whether different responses are aligned with human preferences. For example, [28, 193] use general
LLM (ChatGPT) to get better alignment with human preferences. The Aplaca prompts [143] is
used as sampling queries to different models generate responses. And these data was evaluated
by LLM-as-a-Judge to obtain human preference scores (reward score) to train a new language
model. Other works would like to use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) model itself as evaluator, like
generating better-aligned datasets for SFT including hindsight-modified prompts [91, 205] and
principle-driven self-alignment [137].
   In addition, the lack of domain-specific model training data is a common phenomenon. In order to
obtain annotated high-quality data, it is also very common to use LLM-as-a-Judge for the generation
and evaluation of domain data. WizardMath [98] would use its Instruction Reward Model (IRM) as
Evaluator, aiming to judge the quality of the evolved instructions on three aspects: i) Definition, ii)
Precision, and iti) Integrity. To produce the ranking list training data of IRM, for each instruction,
ChatGPT and Wizard-E are used to generate 2-4 evolved instructions respectively. Then we leverage
Wizard-E to rank the quality of those 4-8 instructions.
   However, solely relying on LLM-as-a-Judge for data annotation poses challenges, particularly
as the value of annotated data diminishes with the rapid improvement of model performance.
To address this, approaches like Self-Taught Evaluator [158] offer a promising alternative by
eliminating the need for human annotations. This method leverages synthetic training data, starting

                        OUTPUTS


Fig. 7. LLM-as-a-Judge appears in two common forms in the agent. The left diagram is Agent-as-a-Juge,
designing a complete agent to serve as an evaluator. The right diagram shows using LLM-as-a-Judge in the
process of an Agent.



with unlabeled instructions and generating contrasting outputs from models. These outputs are
then used to train an LLM-as-a-Judge to produce reasoning traces and final judgments. With
each iteration, the evaluator improves by learning from its refined predictions, creating a cycle of
continuous self-enhancement. This iterative approach not only keeps annotations relevant but also
ensures that evaluators evolve alongside advancing models.
   Recent research on evaluating multimodal data focuses on addressing vision-language misalign-
ments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which often cause hallucinations—outputs
inconsistent with visual or contextual evidence [24, 82, 154]. Techniques like RLHF and Factually
Augmented RLHF have been employed to improve model alignment by incorporating structured
ground-truth data and image captions, enhancing hallucination detection [136]. Benchmarks such
as MLLM-as-a-Judge [17] assess these models using tasks like scoring, pair comparison, and batch
ranking, revealing limitations in alignment with human preferences. Persistent issues include biases
(e.g., position, verbosity) and hallucinations, with even advanced models like GPT-4V displaying
challenges. While pair comparison tasks align better with human judgment, scoring and batch
ranking require significant improvements for reliable deployment. These findings emphasize the
need for innovative frameworks and datasets to refine MLLM evaluation and alignment.

2.4.3 LLM-as-a-Judge for Agents. There are two ways to apply LLM-as-a-Judge for an agent.
One is to evaluate the entire process of the intelligent agent [226], and the other is to evaluate it at
a specific stage in the agent framework process [43, 128]. Both approaches are briefly illustrated in
Figure 7. Using LLM as the brain of agent, an agentic system [226] could evaluate like a human, it
would reduce the need for human involvement and eliminate the trade-off between thoroughness
and effort. In addition, the agent [128] can interact with the environment through language and
receive feedback on actions through LLM to make decisions for the next action.

2.4.4 LLM-as-a-Judge for Reasoning/Thinking. Reasoning [50], defined as the cognitive pro-
cess of applying logic, arguments, and evidence to draw conclusions, is central to intellectual tasks
such as decision-making, problem-solving, and critical analysis. While reasoning is inherently
more demanding and multifaceted than judging, it often depends on judgments to ensure logical

coherence, refine intermediate steps, and achieve clarity in its outcomes. LLM-as-a-Judge, in this
sense, becomes an integral tool for enhancing the reasoning capability of LLM.
   The role of LLM-as-a-Judge in enhancing reasoning or thinking can be understood through
two frameworks: scaling training time [37, 150] and scaling test time [129]. In the training phase,
LLM-as-a-Judge frequently operates within reinforcement learning paradigms, where it functions
as a reward model or evaluator for data or processes. This enables the creation of high-quality
reasoning datasets through mechanisms such as step-by-step verification [84], Direct Preference
Optimization(DPO) [115], and self-refinement [192]. Recently, several LLMs trained with reinforce-
ment learning to exhibit advanced reasoning and thinking abilities have gained attention, such as
o11 , DeepSeek-R12 ,gemini-thinking3 , and QVQ4 . In the test-time framework, LLM-as-a-Judge is
crucial for evaluating and selecting the best reasoning paths. For example, in "Best-of-N" gener-
ation scenarios, where multiple reasoning outputs are produced, the judge determines the most
accurate and coherent response. This dual role in both training and test phases demonstrates the
indispensable nature of LLM-as-a-Judge in enhancing reasoning systems.

      Reliability Concerns of Evaluation Pipeline

      Within the broader evaluation pipeline, several factors can compromise the integrity of
      LLM-based assessments. When evaluating models, inherent biases such as position bias and
      self-enhancement can significantly impact fairness, requiring careful mitigation strategies.
      In data evaluation contexts, the extensive use of LLM-as-a-Judge for pseudo-labeling risks
      amplifying existing model biases, potentially leading to the generation of unverified and
      flawed training data. For agentic frameworks, the sequential application of LLM-as-a-Judge
      can lead to the accumulation of errors, where early misjudgments cascade into signifi-
      cant inaccuracies in final decisions. Moreover, evaluating complex reasoning tasks poses a
      particular risk; without robust verification of logical consistency, LLMs may produce seem-
      ingly confident but fundamentally flawed evaluations, undermining trust in sophisticated
      analytical processes.


2.5          Quick Practice
To effectively apply LLM-as-a-Judge design, it is recommended to find more effective configurations
in the testing cycle for various scenarios. Crucially, reliable testing should form the bedrock of this
quick practice, necessitating iterative refinement, continuous feedback loops, and the establishment
of clear reliability metrics. The overarching aim is to continuously optimize evaluation stability
and consistency through dedicated, reliability-focused testing cycles. The success of using LLM-
as-a-Judge also heavily depends on the implementation details, including the task complexity, the
prompt design, the model selected, and the post-processing method.
   As shown in Figure 8, The process of quick practice for LLM-as-a-Judge involves four main
stages. First is the thinking phase, in which users define the evaluation objectives by determining
what needs to be evaluated, understanding typical human evaluation approaches, and identifying
some reliable evaluation examples. This initial conceptualization is vital for preempting potential
ambiguities and biases that could compromise the fairness and accuracy of subsequent LLM
judgments.

   Next is prompt design, detailed in Section 2.1, where both wording and formats matter. The most
efficient and generally effective approach involves specifying scoring dimensions, emphasizing
relative comparisons for improved assessments, and creating effective examples to guide the LLM.
Careful prompt engineering is essential to mitigate issues like output variability and inter-rater
reliability, ensuring the LLM consistently interprets and responds to evaluation criteria as intended.
   The third stage, model selection (Section 2.2), focuses on choosing a large-scale model with
strong reasoning and instruction-following abilities to ensure reliable evaluations. The inherent
biases and generalization limitations of different models, as well as their black-box nature, under-
score the importance of selecting a robust and well-understood backbone to minimize evaluation
inconsistencies and unverified judgments.
   Finally, standardizing the evaluation process ensures that the outputs are structured (Section 2.3).
This can be achieved by using specific formats like \boxed{XX}, numerical scores, or binary responses
(e.g., "Yes" or "No"). Such standardization is crucial to counteract the fragility of token extraction
methods and the potential for stylistic biases to propagate, thereby enhancing the interpretability
and validity of the final evaluation results. The entire process includes iterative testing with cases
and refinement through retesting, thereby enhancing reliability. During development, it is essential
to compare models or prompts and verify ongoing improvements.

3   IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY
When directly utilizing LLMs to conduct evaluation tasks—such as scoring, selection, pairwise com-
parison, or ranking—their inherent biases of LLMs like length bias, position bias, and concreteness
bias[110] will undermine evaluation outcomes. Mitigating these inherent biases and improving
the overall evaluation performance of LLMs remains a critical challenge for applying LLMs as
evaluators. In this section, we introduce three improvement strategies to boost the evaluation
performance of LLM-as-a-judge: design strategy of evaluation prompts (in-context learning based),
improvement strategy of LLMs’ evaluation capabilities (model-based), and optimization strategy of
final evaluation results (post-processing based). As shown in Figure 9, our categorization is based
on the formal definition of LLM-as-a-judge in Section 2, focusing on enhancing the evaluation
effectiveness by targeting three key phases of the process: the context C , the abilities of LLMs
themselves P L L M and the post-processing ← to obtain the final results E

3.1     Prompt Design Strategy
An evaluation prompt is an input to LLM evaluators, which is used to guide the LLMs to complete
the required evaluation tasks. LLMs possess in-context learning ability, enabling them to learn how
to perform specified tasks from relevant examples or instructions in prompts, without requiring
weight updates or retraining[14]. This suggests that the design strategy of evaluation prompts will
significantly impact the effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge. Therefore, to achieve reliable evaluations,
researchers have experimented with diverse prompt design strategies, including improving LLMs’
task understanding and standardizing LLMs’ output format in the prompt. This approach mitigates
reliability concerns of In-context learning mentioned in Section 2.1, such as unstable results,
inter-rater inconsistency, ambiguity in response, and positional or length biases.

3.1.1 Improving LLMs’ Task Understanding. In optimization methods of prompting LLMs
to better understand evaluation tasks, one of the most commonly used and effective approaches
is few-shot prompting[14]. By incorporating several high-quality evaluation examples into the
evaluation prompts, LLM evaluators can effectively grasp the objectives, general processes, and

A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


rough evaluation criteria of evaluation tasks. Many research works employ this prompt paradigm
for evaluation, such as FActScore[104], SALAD-Bench[80], and GPTScore[33].
   In addition to providing high-quality examples, refining the evaluation task instructions is also
an effective approach to optimizing LLMs’ understanding of evaluation tasks. Current methods for
refining evaluation tasks mainly include the decomposition of evaluation steps and criteria:
    • (a) Decomposition of Evaluation Steps entails breaking down the entire evaluation tasks
      into smaller steps, providing detailed definitions and constraints for each small step in
      prompts, thereby guiding LLMs comprehensively through the whole evaluation pipeline.
      For instance, G-Eval[93] and DHP[163] use Chain-of-Thought(CoT)[167] to guide LLMs.
      SocREval[44] employs the Socratic method to meticulously design each step to enhance
      evaluation performance. In existing research, this paradigm resembles providing detailed and
      sequential execution steps within a single prompt for a one-time evaluation, which guides
      the LLM-as-a-judge to complete evaluation tasks aligned with requirements, as illustrated in
      Fig 10(a). To better understand this paradigm, we present a demonstrative example prompt
      for evaluating summary quality: "You will be given a summary written for an article. . . . . . .
      Evaluation Steps: 1. Read the Summary Thoroughly: Before diving into the evaluation, ensure that
      you ...; 2. Identify the Central Topic: A coherent summary will have a clear central topic or theme
      ...; 3. Look for Transitional Elements: Coherent summaries often have clear transitions between
      sentences or ideas ...; 4. Check for Logical Flow: Review the summary for logical sequencing ...
      X. Give a Score: ... Source Article: {{ Article }} Summary: {{ Summary }}". In this example, the
      evaluation task for summary quality is decomposed into many small steps to guide the LLM
      through the entire assessment process—from reading and analyzing to scoring—enabling
      methodical evaluation of a summary.
    • (b) Decomposition of Evaluation Criteria involves breaking down coarse evaluation crite-
      ria like Fluency into finer-grained sub-criteria like Grammar, Engagingness, and Readability,
      and then generating overall scores based on these different dimensions. Saha et al. propose
      Branch-Solve-Merge(BSM)[120], which divides evaluation tasks into multiple parallel sub-
      tasks based on different sub-criteria for separate evaluation and final merge. HD-Eval[94]
      proposes a hierarchical criteria decomposition method to iteratively align LLM evaluators
      with human preference, thereby addressing the potential bias in LLMs. Hu and Gao et al.[47]
      summarize and clearly define an explicit hierarchical classification system encompassing 11
      criteria, addressing the issue of LLMs potentially confusing different evaluation standards.
      Different from the decomposition of steps, this paradigm presents greater complexity due
      to significant variations in evaluation requirements and procedures across different criteria
      dimensions. Current methodologies tend to decompose the original evaluation task into mul-
      tiple sub-tasks based on distinct criteria. Each sub-task is assessed via a distinct prompt, with
      results subsequently merged or simply listed in a score table, as demonstrated in Fig 10(b).
   In conclusion, these decompositions are specific to enable LLMs to understand the details of
evaluation tasks more deeply, thereby aligning evaluation results more closely with human evalua-
tion requirements and preferences. Providing detailed evaluation specifications and enhancing task
comprehension can mitigate inter-rater inconsistency to some extent, while also reducing potential
ambiguity.
   Furthermore, the evaluation capabilities can be optimized based on specific shortcomings of
LLMs in prompts. For instance, to address specific biases like position bias, which is common in
pairwise evaluations, several research efforts have optimized prompt design by randomly swapping
contents to be evaluated. Wang et al.[155] analyzed and validated the impact of position bias
on LLM-as-a-judge and proposed a calibration framework to mitigate this bias by swapping the

                                                                              J. Gu, X. Jiang, Z. Shi, J. Guo, et al.




                    Fig. 10. Simplified Evaluation Pipeline of Two Decomposition Paradigms.


contents and averaging the scores. Auto-J[79] and JudgeLM[222] also enhance the evaluation
consistency by shuffling the texts to be evaluated. In contrast to averaging scores, PandaLM[162]
annotates the conflicting evaluation results after swapping as "Tie" to address the position bias.
Since the content to be evaluated in each positional arrangement is taken into account during
evaluation, the final evaluation results are thus reliable and free from positional bias.
   To address the challenge of LLMs’ absolute scoring being less robust than relative comparing[116],
some research works convert scoring tasks into pairwise comparison, thereby enhancing the
reliability of evaluation results. Liu et al.[95] transform the scoring evaluation to ranking evaluation
and introduce Pairwise-Preference Search (PARIS), which employs LLMs to conduct pairwise
comparisons locally and efficiently ranks candidate texts globally, making evaluation results more
aligned with human preferences. Unlike single numerical scores, which are more susceptible to
prompt variations and inherent randomness, pairwise comparisons generate relative assessments.
This approach only requires LLMs to evaluate the relative merits between candidates, consequently
yielding more stable and reliable results.
   In summary, the design of prompts for better understanding evaluation tasks is a core method
for optimizing LLMs’ in-contextual learning abilities. By refining task instructions and criteria
in prompts or few-shot prompting with high-quality examples, the details of evaluation prompts
can be enriched, and the understanding of LLMs on evaluation tasks can be directly or indirectly
enhanced. Additionally, targeted adjustments to prompts can address potential biases of LLMs,
such as position bias. Thus, by improving LLMs’ task understanding, the inconsistent inter-rater
reliability, the ambiguity in response, and the biases mentioned in Section 2.1 can be solved.
3.1.2 Standardizing LLMs’ Output Format. Directly requiring LLM evaluators to output
evaluation results poses robustness problems. The response may unexpectedly vary due to the
inherent generative randomness of LLMs, such as outputting text like "low relevance" while asked
to measure with discrete scores, which hinders the automated extraction of evaluation results
from LLM’s output. An effective method to enhance the robustness of output forms is to constrain

A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


the output in structured formats within prompts. G-Eval[93] and DHP framework[163] perform
evaluation tasks with a form-filling paradigm, constraining outputs with formats like "X: Y", where
X represents the dimension or metric to be evaluated and Y denotes an identifiable output form
like scores or specific tokens. LLM-EVAL[86] further modifies this form-filling paradigm, efficiently
outputs evaluation results in JSON format, and obtains multidimensional scores, leveraging LLMs’
high understanding and generation capabilities of code-like textural formats.
   Apart from challenges in robustness, directly outputting evaluation results by LLMs also suffers
from a lack of interpretability. The meaning of evaluation results from LLM evaluators is difficult to
align consistently with the instructions and metrics provided in prompts. To address the challenges,
CLAIR[16] requires LLMs to output evaluation scores between 0-100 simultaneously with relevant
reasons as explanations in JSON format, which enhances the rationality and interpretability of the
scores. FLEUR[74] utilizes LLaVA to first provide quality scores for image captions and subsequently
asks with "Why? Tell me the reason." for explanations with the images, captions, and scores as
inputs, offering a stepwise approach to provide interpretable scores.
   In general, by constraining or guiding the output process and format of LLM evaluators within
prompts, the robustness and rationality of evaluation results can be effectively improved through
structured outputs. This also facilitates the automated post-processing of evaluation results in
subsequent steps, thereby enhancing the overall stability of the evaluation pipeline.

3.2 Capability Enhancement Strategy
The evaluation capabilities of LLMs are a reflection of their powerful general language under-
standing and generation abilities triggered by specific prompts. Methods for optimizing evaluation
through prompt design——focused on LLMs’ in-contextual learning capabilities——require LLMs
to comprehend the meaning of prompts fully and consistently follow the relevant evaluation
instructions. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 encounter problems such as concep-
tual confusion[47], and smaller open-source LLMs have even more limitations in their evaluation
capabilities. Fine-tuning LLMs may be a common approach, but as mentioned at the end of Sec-
tion 2.2, fine-tuned LLMs might exhibit limited generalization capability beyond their training
data distribution, and could also remain susceptible to subtle biases within the fine-tuning data
that compromise fairness, leading to inconsistencies with human judgment. Therefore, researchers
propose two solutions: On one hand, constructing fairer training datasets to fine-tune LLMs and
eliminate judgment biases; on the other hand, implementing feedback-driven iterative refinement
methods, which continuously update LLMs during usage to enhance their generalization capability,
ultimately achieving reliable evaluation models.

3.2.1 Specialized Fine-tuning. A straightforward approach to enhancing the evaluation ca-
pabilities of LLMs is to fine-tune them via meta-evaluation datasets specifically constructed for
evaluation tasks, which helps improve the LLMs’ understanding of specific evaluation prompts,
boosts the evaluation performance, or addresses potential biases. The most critical step in this
optimization strategy is the collection and construction of training data, since LLMs will adhere
to the instructional formats defined by the training data and inherit any potentially subtle biases,
ultimately affecting the evaluation performance. As shown in Fig 11, there are primarily two
approaches to constructing meta-evaluation data: Evaluation Templates and Deep Transformation.
The former typically populates sampled raw data into preset templates to form training data, while
the latter employs algorithms or models to transform raw data in terms of style, content, and
structure, thereby constructing training data more flexibly.
   Using evaluation templates is a common method, which involves sampling evaluation questions
from publicly available datasets, modifying them with certain templates, and supplementing the

dataset with evaluation responses generated either manually or by powerful LLMs like GPT-4.
For instance, PandaLM[162] samples inputs and instructions from Alpaca 52K[143] and generates
responses using GPT-3.5 to construct training data, while SALAD-Bench[80] builds its training
data from a subset of LMSYS-Chat[214] and Toxicchat[87].
   To better align with the requirements of evaluation tasks, many research works further transform
inputs and instructions sampled from public datasets to construct more targeted training data.
OffsetBias[110] aims to reduce biases of LLMs by using GPT4 to generate off-topic versions of the
original inputs and then having GPT-3.5 respond to the new inputs to produce bad responses. By
pairing good and bad responses as training data to fine-tune the LLMs as evaluators, the biases in
LLMs are significantly reduced, including length bias, concreteness bias, knowledge bias, and so
on. JudgeLM[222] enhances LLMs’ evaluation capabilities by creating different types of training
data through paradigms like reference support and reference drop. CritiqueLLM[61] proposes a
multi-path prompting approach, combining pointwise-to-pairwise and referenced-to-reference-free
prompting strategies to restructure referenced pointwise grading data into four types, which helps
create Eval-Instruct to fine-tune LLMs, addressing shortcomings in pointwise grading and pairwise
comparison. Yu et al.[188] sample data from the preference dataset and rewrite judge templates to
synthesize training data, and use GPT-4o to analyze and judge the pairs of answers in the synthetic
data. The correct judgments, along with the synthetic data and analysis, will be processed as
training data for the SFT phase of judge models.
   In summary, constructing meta-evaluation training data targeted at specific evaluation tasks and
fine-tuning LLMs can directly adjust the model’s internal parameterized knowledge and language
abilities. This is the most straightforward method to improve the evaluation performance of LLM
evaluators and address potential biases.
3.2.2 Feedback-Driven Iterative Refinement. Fine-tuning LLMs on meta-evaluation datasets
gives them the ability to produce evaluations that are more aligned with human preferences.
However, as discussed in Section 2.2, LLMs exhibit version dependency, and even fine-tuned models
remain constrained by their training data and inherently suffer from out-of-distribution limitations
to some extent. Consequently, LLM-as-a-Judge may still exhibit biases during evaluation processes
in practice, ultimately compromising evaluation quality. A natural improvement strategy is to
iteratively optimize the model based on the feedback of evaluation results, which mainly comes
from stronger models or directly from human evaluators’ corrections of the evaluation results.

, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


   A typical example is INSTRUCTSCORE[176]. To improve model performance and further benefit
the final quality score calculation, this scoring framework collects failure modes of metric outputs,
queries GPT-4 on each failure mode to gather automatic feedback, and finally selects explana-
tions most aligned with human preferences to iteratively fine-tune the LLaMA model. Unlike
INSTRUCTSCORE, which directly optimizes the model, the LLM evaluator in JADE[202] relies
on human judges to correct LLMs’ evaluation results and updates the most frequently corrected
samples into the example sets for few-shot prompting. JADE utilizes this relatively low-cost method
to achieve iterative updates of the evaluation capabilities.
   Iterative optimization methods are not limited to offline training. The success of R1-style methods
shows the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Thus, feedback-based
online learning constitutes another strategic form of iterative optimization. Think-J[48] integrates
both offline and online learning approaches. The offline approach trains a critic model to evaluate
judgments from the judge model, thereby constructing positive and negative samples for SFT and
DPO optimization. The online approach continuously optimizes the judge model using the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm with rule-based rewards as optimization feedback.
   Since the feedback is more closely aligned with human preferences, LLMs can dynamically
optimize their evaluation capabilities based on the feedback, leading to better evaluation results.
This feedback-driven iterative refinement strategy addresses the problem of models’ imperfect
generalization and improves the evaluation capabilities through dynamic updates.

3.3   Final Output Optimization Strategy
Through optimization based on in-context learning and the model’s own capabilities, LLMs have
become fairly reliable evaluators that are capable of understanding evaluation task requirements
and providing rational evaluation results. However, the inherent generative randomness of LLM
black boxes, the fragility of output extraction methods, and potential adversarial manipulations,
as noted at the end of Section 2.3, may collectively contribute to unreliable and unfair evaluation
results. Therefore, it is necessary for LLM evaluators to design optimization strategies during
the post-processing stage from the outputs to the final evaluation results. Some strategies opt
to directly modify output acquisition methods to extract evaluation results more robustly, while
more mainstream strategies focus on designing frameworks that integrate multi-source evaluation
results, which mitigate adverse effects caused by randomness and fragility, and enhance resistance
to adversarial manipulations.

3.3.1 Integrating Multi-Source Evaluation Results. Integrating multiple evaluation results
for the same content to obtain the final result is a common strategy in various experiments and
engineering pipelines, which can reduce the impacts of accidental factors and random errors. The
most basic optimization strategy is to perform multiple runs of evaluation on the same content
with different hyper-parameters and settings, and then summarize these results. For example, the
work of Sottana et al.[133] reduces randomness in evaluations by averaging multiple scores of
the same sample. Similarly, PsychoBench[51] takes the mean and standard deviation from ten
independent runs. Auto-J[79] further amplifies the differences between evaluation rounds, which
combine critiques with and without scenario criteria to obtain the final results.
   In addition to integrating results from multiple rounds of evaluation, using multiple LLM evalua-
tors to assess the contents simultaneously and integrating the results is another effective method,
which can reduce biases introduced by LLMs. For instance, CPAD[89] utilizes ChatGLM-6B[31],
Ziya-13B[200], and ChatYuan-Large-v2[201] as evaluators to evaluate the contents and obtain the
final results by voting. Bai et al.[8] propose a novel evaluation method called decentralized peer
review of LLMs, which utilizes LLMs that generate content to evaluate each other’s generated

                                                        , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.

content and eventually integrate the results. EvalMORAAL[105] also employs a similar LLM-as-a-
judge peer review mechanism, detecting conflicts in evaluation results by checking whether score
differences exceed a preset threshold, and uses majority voting to resolve conflicts.
   The aforementioned multi-round or multi-model approaches represent a type of peer-parallel
evaluation strategy, and their integration process is relatively straightforward. Researchers have
also proposed many more complex evaluation frameworks featuring greater interactivity between
different evaluations. For example, Jaehun Jung et al. proposed Cascaded Selective Evaluation[57].
This framework transitions from weaker, smaller models to stronger, larger models based on
confidence, allowing the majority of evaluations to be handled by smaller models, which significantly
reduces the costs of computing resources and improves efficiency. Recent work [203], on the other
hand, proposed Crowd-based Comparative Evaluation. This method utilizes multiple LLMs to
construct crowd responses based on candidate responses for comparison, thereby generating
multiple crowd judgments that serve as reference content for the final evaluation. This enables
LLM-as-a-Judge to capture richer details and enhance evaluation reliability.
   In summary, forming the final evaluation results by combining multiple rounds of evaluations or
multiple LLM evaluators can reduce the random effects caused by accidental factors in a single
round and reduce the potential biases of a single LLM evaluator. This strategy significantly enhances
the stability and reliability of the evaluation results.



3.3.2 Direct Output Optimization. Different from obtaining evaluation results based on the
outputs of multiple rounds or LLMs, directly optimizing the output of a single LLM evaluator
involves further processing the evaluation output to make it more reliable, especially when dealing
with scoring outputs from LLM evaluators. Due to the inherent randomness in LLMs’ generation,
the scores may not fully reflect the LLMs’ complete view of the evaluation criteria. Therefore,
to obtain more reliable evaluation results, it is necessary to optimize the LLM’s score outputs.
An effective optimization strategy is to combine the implicit logits, which capture the LLMs’
randomness, with the explicit output scores. For example, FLEUR[74] proposes a score smoothing
strategy. For scores generated by LLaVA, the probability of the token corresponding to each digit
𝑙 (0≤ 𝑙 ≤9) would be used as the weight to smooth the explicit scores and calculate the final
evaluation scores. TrustJudge[161] proposes a distribution-sensitive scoring method that computes
continuous expectations from discrete scoring probabilities, and a likelihood-aware aggregation
method that utilizes bidirectional preference probabilities, to process the evaluation results from
LLMs, addressing the inconsistency in LLM-as-a-Judge.
   However, methods like score smoothing, which combine implicit logits and explicit outputs,
require the LLMs to be open-source or to provide interfaces that allow access to token probabilities,
which brings some limitations. Inspired by the work of Weng et al.[168] and Madaan et al.[103],
self-verification can be used to filter out the evaluation results without sufficient robustness. For
example, TrueTeacher[39] applies self-verification in its evaluation of distilled data by asking the
LLM evaluator for its certainty about the evaluation results after providing them and retaining
only those results that pass self-verification. Self-verification is suitable for all LLMs and requires
no complex computing and processing.
   In summary, compared to integrating multiple evaluation results, directly optimizing the LLMs’
outputs to obtain the final results is faster and lower-cost, although the effectiveness still needs fur-
ther validation. However, these two approaches are not mutually exclusive. Performing integration
after direct optimization of LLMs’ output may lead to more stable evaluation results.

4     EVALUATION OF LLM-AS-A-JUDGE
Following the discussions on the application and enhancement of LLM-as-a-Judge, we now address
the critical question of its evaluation. While the basic evaluation pipeline provides a conceptual
foundation, it does not inherently guarantee the reliability of the system. To formally capture this
essential property, we recall the enhanced formal definition of reliability:

                                            R ← 𝑓R (PL L M , 𝑥, C)
   This formulation highlights that reliability R is a function of three independent variables: the
LLM’s probability function (PL L M ), the input being evaluated (𝑥), and the accompanying context
(C). Assessing LLM-as-a-Judge, therefore, requires a systematic examination of how these three
factors collectively influence its performance.
   Reliability may degrade if the underlying model, defined by its probability function PL L M ,
exhibits inherent biases or instability. For instance, a less robust LLM may produce inconsistent
scores for identical prompts and inputs due to sampling variance or internal preference drift.
Similarly, the quality of evaluation is susceptible to the nature of the input 𝑥. Noisy or adversarially
perturbed inputs can cause the LLM to misjudge quality, thus diminishing its robustness. Finally,
subtle changes in the prompt wording or the ordering of the context C can lead to different
judgments for the same input, a phenomenon that undermines reliability.
   Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-as-a-Judge requires examining multiple aspects.
We organize existing evaluation studies into three major dimensions: agreement with human
judgments (Section 4.1), bias (Section 4.2), and adversarial robustness (Section 4.3), as depicted in
Figure 12.

4.1    Agreement with Human Judgments
Given that the initial motivation of LLM-as-a-judge lies in replacing human annotation, the foremost
aspect of its evaluation should naturally be the extent to which it aligns with human judgments.
Numerous studies approach this by considering the LLM evaluator as a virtual annotator and
evaluating the extent of its agreement with human annotators. The percentage agreement metric

                                                                    , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.

represents the proportion of samples on which LLM and human annotators agree [144].

where D is the dataset, 𝑆 llm and 𝑆 human are the evaluation results of the LLM evaluator and human
judge, respectively, which can be in the form of both score or rank. Additionally, widely used
correlation metrics such as Cohen’s Kappa [144] and Spearman’s correlation [8, 95] are also
employed to assess agreement. Other works treat the LLM-as-a-judge task as a classification
problem, where human annotations serve as the labels, and compute precision and recall to evaluate
the performance [162, 222].

   Datasets. Both of the above metrics rely on the datasets with LLM-generated responses and
responding human judgments. Therefore, there is also a practical need to construct a comprehensive
benchmark for the meta-evaluation. Table 1 shows existing banchmarks. MTBench [213] has only 80
human-crafted queries with their corresponding human annotation and LLMs’ responses. FairEval
[155] is constructed from the 80 queries from VicunaBench [148] with human-annotated preference
between ChatGPT and Vicuna responses. Chatbot Arena Conversations [213] is a larger collection
of crowdsourced data (about 30k) with human annotated preferences. Research [195] constructs
a benchmark to assess the capability of the LLM evaluator in evaluating whether a response
follows the instruction. This dataset contains human-curated 419 pairs of outputs, one adhering to
instructions while the other diverging, yet may possess deceptive qualities that mislead an LLM
evaluator. Research [17] evaluates the capabilities of multi-modal LLMs in assisting evaluation
tasks across various modalities and introduces MLLM-as-a-Judge, a comprehensive multi-modal
benchmark. Recent advances also expand the scope of meta-evaluation benchmarks to specialized
domains, including code assessment [212] and non-English language tasks [130]. Furthermore,
CALM [185] presents a systematic framework for bias quantification, featuring an automated
perturbation mechanism to generate meta-evaluation data for examining 12 distinct types of
potential biases in LLM evaluators.
   Current meta-evaluation primarily focuses on LLM-as-a-judge for models, while there is a lack of
sufficient meta-evaluation when these LLM evaluators are used for automatically annotating large-
scale datasets (Section 2.4.2). We advocate for more rigorous assessment of the alignment between
LLM-as-a-judge and human judgment when they are employed for large-scale data annotation.
Additionally, it is also crucial to assess the potential bias and robustness, which will be discussed in
the following sections.

A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


4.2   Bias
As LLM-as-a-Judge becomes more widely deployed, it has been observed to manifest a range of
salient biases, even in cases where its evaluations align with human judgments. Prior studies have
emphasized that large language models inherently exhibit diverse forms of bias across different
tasks [25, 34, 138]. Such internal biases may propagate into the LLM-as-a-Judge setting, potentially
resulting in unfair evaluation outcomes and, in turn, influencing the development of downstream
LLMs. Consequently, it is imperative to both characterize the types of biases that LLM evaluators
may carry and to establish systematic approaches for their assessment. In this section, we review the
major categories of biases in the context of LLM-as-a-Judge, outlining their definitions, associated
metrics, and datasets commonly employed for evaluation.
   The meta-evaluation of LLM-as-a-judge introduces systematic biases that can be broadly catego-
rized into two classes: task-agnostic biases inherent to LLMs across general applications, and
judgment-specific biases unique to LLM-as-a-judge scenarios. This taxonomy aims to clarify
their distinct characteristics and implications. The former may be partially attributed to the charac-
teristics of the judgment task itself, such as its specific input-output format, which could potentially
be mitigated through task-specific design. In contrast, task-agnostic biases are more fundamental
issues inherent to the LLMs themselves and are therefore more difficult to address. Mitigating such
biases likely depends on advancements in the foundation models.

4.2.1 Task-Agnostic Biases. These biases manifest across diverse LLM applications, including
open-domain QA, classification, and summarization. However, when arising in the LLM-as-a-judge,
the biases are particularly critical due to their cascading effects on downstream tasks. When LLM-
generated judgments serve as feedback for model training or data annotation, these biases risk
being amplified and propagated. We present a few typical examples and recommend consulting
comprehensive reviews on language model bias [35, 42] for a more thorough understanding.
   Diversity Bias refers to bias against certain demographic groups [185], including certain genders
[19], race, and sexual orientation [70]. In the context of LLM-as-a-judge scenarios, this bias may
appear when evaluators give higher scores to responses that align with stereotypes of certain
groups.
   Cultural Bias. In general domains, cultural bias refers to situations where models might misin-
terpret expressions from different cultures or fail to recognize regional language variants [35]. In
the context of LLM-as-a-judge, it indicates that evaluators might score expressions from unfamiliar
cultures poorly.
   Self-Enhancement Bias describes the phenomenon that LLM evaluators may prefer responses
generated by themselves [185, 213]. This bias has also been known as source bias in retrieval
task [26] and open-domain question answering systems [138]. Considering the significant self-
enhancement bias, as suggested in [185], we should avoid using the same model as the evaluator.
This is only a stopgap, as we may not use the optimal evaluator when evaluating the most advanced
LLMs.

4.2.2 Judgment-Specific Biases. Judgment-specific biases are either unique to the LLM-as-a-
judge setting or have a significant impact on judgment tasks. A classic example is the "position
bias", which has a more pronounced effect in the context of LLM-as-a-judge, where the evaluator
often needs to compare pairwise responses. Different from task-agnostic biases, judgment-specific
biases are more difficult to resolve naturally with the development of foundational large model
capabilities and require targeted optimization for judgment tasks.
   Position Bias is the tendency of LLM evaluators to favor responses in certain positions within
the prompt [126, 144, 155, 185]. This bias may have detrimental effects, as Vicuna-13B could

                                                         , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
                                                                        J. Gu, X. Jiang, Z. Shi, J. Guo, et al.


outperform ChatGPT when evaluated by ChatGPT, simply by positioning the response of Vicuna-
13B in the second place [155]. To measure this bias, recent work [126] proposed two metrics:
Position Consistency, which quantifies how frequently a judge model selects the same response
after changing their positions, and Preference Fairness, which measures the extent to which judge
models favor a response in certain positions. The study [155] also introduced a metric Conflict
Rate to measure the percent of disagreement after changing the position of two candidate responses.
Their analytical experiments reveal that the degree of positional bias fluctuates depending on the
disparity in response quality, and the preferred position varies with different LLMs. For instance,
GPT-4 tends to favor the first position, while ChatGPT shows a preference for the second position.
   Compassion-fade bias describes the effect of the model names [66, 185]. This tendency oc-
curs when we explicitly provide model names. for instance, evaluators may be inclined to give
higher scores to results labeled as “gpt-4”. This tendency underscores the necessity of anonymous
evaluation.
   Style Bias refers to the tendency towards a certain text style. As revealed in [19], an evaluator
may also prefer visually appealing content, regardless of its actual validity, such as the text with
emojis. Furthermore, LLM evaluators may favor responses with certain emotional tones, such as
cheerful, sad, angry, and fearful, which is defined as sentiment bias [75, 185].
   Length Bias refers to the tendency to favor responses of a particular length, such as a preference
for more verbose responses, which is also known as verbosity bias [49, 110, 185, 213]. Length bias
can be revealed by rephrasing one of the original responses into a more verbose one [185, 213]. Even
though these expansions do not introduce new information, there is still concern regarding changes
to the original response in terms of perplexity, fluency, or style. Alternatively, a previous study
[121] investigated this bias by comparing multiple sampled responses and revealed a statistical
tendency towards longer answers. However, ensuring the comparable quality of multiple samples
remains a challenging problem.
   Concreteness Bias reflects that LLM evaluators favor responses with specific details, including
citation of authoritative sources, numerical values, and complex terminologies, which is called
authority bias [110] or citation bias [19, 185]. The negative effects of concreteness bias arise
from the neglect of the factual correctness of these details, thereby encouraging hallucination [1].

4.3    Adversarial Robustness
As LLM-as-a-Judge becomes further integrated into evaluation pipelines and increasingly serves
as the standard protocol, a variety of adversarial attacks have emerged. Adversarial robustness
refers to the ability of a model to withstand deliberate attempts to manipulate the scores through
carefully crafted inputs. Unlike bias evaluations (Section 4.2), which mainly focus on naturally
occurring samples, adversarial robustness involves samples intentionally crafted to manipulate
scoring, such as inserting phrases that artificially enhance scores. Robustness is crucial because
insufficient robustness allows trivial manipulations to deceive the evaluators and to undermine
the evaluation of text quality. Ensuring robust evaluators is essential for maintaining accurate and
reliable assessments, particularly in high-stakes applications.
   Research [116] constructed a surrogate model from the black-box LLM-evaluator and then learn
a adversarial attack phrases based on it. The evaluation score can be drastically inflated by
universally inserting the learned attack phrases without improving the text quality. Similarly, work
by Lee et al. [73] introduced EMBER, a benchmark that revealed biases in when assessing outputs
with epistemic markers, such as expressions of certainty or uncertainty. Furthermore, other work
[216] demonstrated that even a "null model" that outputs a constant response irrelevant to input
instructions can achieve high win rates for various LLM-as-a-judge methods. Similarly, recent work
[211] also revealed that on-word symbols (e.g., “:”) or reasoning openers like “Thought process:” can

A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


often fool LLM evaluators to produce positive evaluations. Several recent works [66, 185] proposed
to increase the evaluation score by adding the majority opinions, such as “90% believe this is
better”. Other research [66, 185] evaluated robustness against meaningless statement in the
System Prompt, e.g., ”Assistant A loves eating pasta”. These works revealed that LLM-as-a-judge
are still insufficiently robust against interference irrelevant to text quality. Defensive measures
like the perplexity score [52, 116] can only detect limited types of adversarial examples. Therefore,
constructing more robust LLM-as-a-judge is a crucial research direction for the future.

                         Fig. 13. LLM-as-a-Judge Meta-evaluation Pipeline and Tools

   In Section 3, we have introduced the improvement strategies in existing LLM-as-a-judge works
to improve the evaluation capabilities of LLMs. Although numerous works have proposed meta-
evaluation benchmarks to assess the performance of LLMs in evaluation tasks, there is a lack
of meta-evaluation on whether these improvement strategies effectively make LLM-as-a-Judge
more reliable. So in the preceding subsection of this Section 4, we systematically introduced the
dimensions and criteria for evaluating the evaluation performance and reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge,
thereby providing quantifiable metrics that inform the evaluation of the aforementioned strategies.
   Based on partial dimensions mentioned in sec 4.1 and sec 4.2, we designed a robust and scalable
meta-evaluation tool as shown in Figure 13 and conducted a simple meta-evaluation experiment
on the improvement strategies summarized in Section 3, examining their effectiveness from the
perspectives of biases and agreement with human evaluation.
4.4.1   Experiment Settings.
   Evaluation Dimensions and Benchmarks. The most direct metric to reflect the quality of
automatic evaluation is the alignment with human evaluation. We use LLMEval2 [207] to assess the
alignment of LLM-as-a-judge with human evaluations. LLMEval2 is the largest and most diverse
evaluation benchmark for LLM-as-a-judge to date, with 2,553 samples compiled from multiple data
sources with human-annotated preferences. Each sample consists of a question, a pair of candidate
responses, and a human label indicating the preferred response.
   Bias is also a crucial dimension for assessing the quality of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results.
We use EVALBIASBENCH [110] to measure six types of biases in LLM-as-a-judge, including length
bias, concreteness bias, empty reference bias, content continuation bias, nested instruction bias,
and familiar knowledge bias. EVALBIASBENCH consists of 80 samples, each containing a question,
a pair of candidate responses, and a label indicating the correct response without bias influence. In
addition to the six types of biases, we also evaluated position bias. The meta-evaluation samples for

                                                                                  J. Gu, X. Jiang, Z. Shi, J. Guo, et al.


position bias are the paired samples constructed by swapping the position of candidate responses
within prompts in samples of LLMEval2 and EVALBIASBENCH.
   Evaluation Metrics. For the alignment with human evaluation, we use Percentage Agreement
Metric[144] for evaluation, as shown in Section 4.1. For biases except for position bias, we use
Accuracy for evaluation, which represents the proportion of samples where LLM-as-a-judge selects
the correct candidate response annotated in EVALBIASBENCH.
   For position bias, we use Position Consistency as the metric, which quantifies how frequently
the LLM-as-a-judge selects the same response after swapping the position of candidate responses.
Formally, given 𝑁 samples {(𝑞𝑖 , 𝑟 1𝑖 , 𝑟 2𝑖 )}𝑖=1𝑁 , for each sample (𝑞 , 𝑟 1 , 𝑟 2 ), we queried the LLM-as-
                                                                                𝑖     𝑖    𝑖
a-judge with two prompts 𝑃 (𝑞𝑖 , 𝑟 1𝑖 , 𝑟 2𝑖 ) and 𝑃 (𝑞𝑖 , 𝑟 2𝑖 , 𝑟 1𝑖 ), and obtained two evaluation results 𝑆𝑖𝑟 12
and 𝑆𝑖𝑟 21 . Each 𝑆𝑖 is 𝑟 1𝑖 , 𝑟 2𝑖 or "TIE". Then we calculate the Position Consistency as follows:
                                                              Í𝑁           𝑟 12 = 𝑆 𝑟 21 )
                                                                   𝑖=1 I(𝑆𝑖        𝑖
                                    Position Consistency =
                                                                            𝑁
where I(·) is the indicator function.
  Target LLMs and Strategies. For LLMs, we selected six LLMs commonly used in the automatic
evaluation, including closed-source LLMs GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and open-source LLMs Qwen2.5-7B,
LLaMA3-8B, Mistral-7B, and Mixtral-8×7B.
  For improvement strategies, we selected Providing Evaluations with Explanations, Self Validation,
Summarize by Multiple Rounds, and Vote by Multiple LLMs, since these strategies are all straight-
forward and relatively common in many works. We adopt GPT-3.5 as the base evaluator for the
meta-evaluation of these improvement strategies.
   Model Configuration. For closed-source LLMs, we interact using OpenAI’s official APIs. The
model versions we selected are GPT-4-turbo and GPT-3.5-turbo, specifically referencing gpt-4-
turbo-2024-04-09 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 respectively1 .
   For open-source LLMs, we adopt Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct2 , Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct3 , Mistral-7B-
Instruct-v0.34 , Mixtral-8×7B-Instruct-v0.15 , deployed on an Ubuntu machine equipped with a 40GB
NVIDIA A100 GPU.
   To stabilize the evaluation results of LLMs, we set the hyper-parameter temperature to 0 to
reduce the impact of randomness in LLMs’ output. For Summarize by Multiple Rounds, we conduct
5 rounds for each sample and verify the effects of three different processing methods for results
of multiple rounds: majority voting(- majority@5), taking the mean score(- mean@5), and taking
the best score(- best@5). For Vote by Multiple LLMs, we conduct experiments on two settings, each
involving three LLMs. Setting 1 consists of GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo, and LLaMA3-8B-Instruct,
while setting 2 consists of GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.
4.4.2    Results and Analysis.
  Comparison with Different LLMs. The experiment results on different LLMs are shown in
Table 2. Comparing the evaluation performance of different LLMs, we found GPT-4 outperformed
other LLMs with a large margin across all meta-evaluation dimensions and showed fewer biases.
  Therefore, when conditions allow, using GPT-4 as an evaluator may obtain more objective
and less biased evaluations. For open-source LLMs, we found that Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct showed

exceptional evaluation capabilities, outperforming other open-source LLMs in the experiments.
Moreover, it surpassed GPT-3.5-turbo in most dimensions except for Position Bias and Nested
Instruction Bias, indicating that it can be a promising choice as an open-source LLM-as-a-Judge,
with the potential to serve as a robust base model for specialized evaluators in specific scenarios.
   Additionally, we observed that, apart from Concreteness Bias and Content Continuation Bias, the
performance of LLMs, except GPT-4-turbo, was generally poor, particularly in the Length Bias. Even
GPT-4-turbo experienced substantial degradation in Empty Reference Bias and Nested Instruction
Bias. While Position Bias can be mitigated by swapping the positions of the inputs, addressing
other biases may require researchers to explore more effective evaluation strategies. Meanwhile,
we also observed that different LLMs in the experiments show no significant differences in the
alignment with humans, and there is clear space for improvement.

                                                                              , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.

   Therefore, to achieve reliable evaluations, suggestions for model selection include: First, prioritiz-
ing powerful or fine-tuned LLMs as foundational evaluators. This approach increases the likelihood
of obtaining human-aligned judgments while leveraging stronger instruction-following and com-
prehension capabilities to handle evaluation prompts with complex strategies. Additionally, it is
advisable to conduct small-scale meta-evaluations before model selection to detect potential biases.
As experimental results demonstrate, different models exhibit varying susceptibility to distinct
biases—even powerful LLMs like GPT-4-Turbo can be severely impacted by specific biases such as
Empty Reference. Thus, understanding a model’s bias profile before selection aids in formulating
effective evaluation strategies and obtaining reliable results.


   Comparison with Different Strategies. Table 4 shows the effectiveness of different improve-
ment strategies for enhancing the evaluation performance of GPT-3.5-turbo. The results reveal that
not all strategies effectively improve LLM-as-a-judge’s performance. Providing with Explanation
(w/ explanation) provides interpretability by offering reasons alongside evaluation scores or selec-
tions, which aids in logical backtracking during human review. However, in terms of evaluation
performance and bias mitigation, it generally has a negative impact. This performance decline is
speculated to be caused by deeper biases introduced by self-explanation. Self Validation (w/ self-
validation) shows minimal effectiveness, likely due to the LLMs’ overconfidence, which may limit
its re-evaluation efforts during self-validation. We will further discuss this limitation in Section 6.1.
   Summarize by Multiple Rounds with majority voting (w/ majority@5) is a strategy with clear
benefits, showing improvements across multiple dimensions. It suggests that taking the major-
ity voting results from repeated evaluations helps reduce the impact of randomness in LLMs,
thereby addressing bias issues. However, Summarize by Multiple Rounds with taking mean score (w/
mean@5) or with taking best score (w/ best-of-5) did not improve the evaluation performance and
even had some adverse effects. Compared to w/ majority@5, which selects the major result from
multiple rounds, w/ mean@5 might include results with biases in the mean score calculation, and
similarly w/ best-of-5 could potentially select overly high scores influenced by biases. Therefore,
the latter two strategies do not effectively mitigate the impact of biases on automated evaluation.
   The evaluation results of Vote by Multiple LLMs (multi LLMs set 1 and set 2) are closely related
to the LLM selection. Comparing set 1 and set 2, where LLaMA3-8B-Instruct was replaced by
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct in set 2, it revealed significant differences in performance across various
dimensions. In set 1, the poor performance of GPT-3.5-turbo and LLaMA3-8B-Instruct in the
Length Bias negatively impacted the overall performance, whereas in set 2, the performance in
this dimension was better, which was aligned with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Similar trends were
observed in dimensions like Position Bias, Familiar Knowledge Bias, and so on. This suggests that
when multiple LLMs are adopted for joint evaluation, the differences between their evaluation
performances must be carefully considered.
   Based on current experiments, several evaluation strategy design suggestions may be beneficial
for achieving reliable evaluations. First, integrating multiple-source results serves as a straightfor-
ward and effective approach. After selecting reliable models as evaluators, integrating multi-source
results effectively mitigates the negative impacts of inherent noise (e.g., stochasticity in LLMs),
enhancing the stability and trustworthiness of evaluation results. Second, experiments comparing
majority@5 and mean@5 strategies reveal that pairwise evaluations by LLMs yield more reliable
results than pointwise—likely because the comparison process better captures nuanced distinctions.
Finally, simultaneously generating evaluations and explanations may not be advisable. While
explanations help humans understand LLM decision processes, their simultaneous execution may
compromise the quality of evaluations.

A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


   Evaluation of Reasoning LLM-as-a-Judge. As discussed in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, judgment
serves as the foundation for effective reasoning capabilities. In other words, models with stronger
reasoning capabilities are generally better equipped to perform as reliable judges. To validate
this assumption, we conducted evaluations on several reasoning LLMs, including o1-mini, o3-
mini, Gemini-thinking, and Deepseek-R1. The results in Tables 2 and 3 provide key insights into
the performance of reasoning-focused LLMs. While these models—gemini-2.0-thinking, o1-mini,
o3-mini, and deepseek r1—demonstrate competitive alignment and accuracy relative to the
top-performing GPT-4-turbo, their improvements in tasks requiring human alignment are
not as pronounced as expected.
   GPT-4-turbo remains the benchmark for alignment, achieving the highest accuracy rates of
68.47% and 69.44% in the human=model1 and human=model2 scenarios, respectively. It also excels
in resolving ambiguous cases, with an accuracy of 29.67% in the human=TIE scenario, outper-
forming all other models. Among reasoning-enhanced models, gemini-2.0-thinking shows strong
performance in the human=model2 scenario, achieving an accuracy of 78.27%—surpassing GPT-4-
turbo—highlighting its capability to identify models that align more closely with human judgment.
However, this strength does not consistently extend to other tasks or scenarios. Similarly, o1-mini
and deepseek-R1, while trailing slightly behind GPT-4-turbo and gemini-2.0-thinking, outperform
non-GPT models like Mixtral-8×7B-Instruct-v0.1, demonstrating the added value of reasoning-based
enhancements in alignment tasks. These results indicate that reasoning-enhanced LLMs provide
meaningful advancements over baseline models but fall short of delivering consistent
advantages in alignment-related tasks, suggesting room for further optimization in this area.

   Experiment Summary. Due to the inherent capabilities and potential risks of LLMs, common
improvement strategies for LLM-as-a-judge are not fully effective in improving the performance or
mitigating biases. The limitations and challenges will be further discussed in Section 6.
   Based on the current experimental analysis, an empirical strategy for pairwise comparison
evaluation tasks is to select more powerful LLMs and to adopt two evaluation strategies:
one is swapping the positions of the evaluation contents, the other is taking the majority
voting results from multiple rounds of evaluation, which can effectively mitigate biases. As
for improving the alignment with humans, further exploration is still needed.

4.5   Rethinking Meta-evaluation
While prior work has introduced various evaluation dimensions, datasets, and metrics, such efforts
remain insufficient for evaluating LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on a comprehensive review of existing
works and the empirical analyses for experiments in sec 4.4, it can be observed that current meta-
evaluation frameworks continue to face substantial limitations, underscoring the need for more
systematic and robust approaches.
   (1) Need for Unified and Comprehensive Benchmark. Given the diverse evaluation dimensions,
such as agreement, multiple types of bias, and adversarial robustness, there is a pressing need
for a unified benchmark that systematically and comprehensively quantifies these biases within
a single framework. As shown in Table 1, EVALBIASBENCH [110] was proposed as a test set to
measure six types of bias. Other work [185] is dedicated to proposing a unified bias testing process,
including automated perturbation and a unified metric. They constructed a bias quantification
framework CALM, which covers 12 types of bias. Despite these efforts, existing work only covers a
subset of evaluation dimensions and lacks a comprehensive framework that includes all relevant
aspects. As a result, many current studies that adopt LLM-as-a-judge still need to design their own
meta-evaluation protocols and conduct manual verification to justify the reliability. Establishing a

unified, systematic, and authoritative meta-evaluation benchmark would significantly advance the
development and adoption of LLM-as-a-judge.
  (2) Challenges of Controlled Study. When evaluating a specific dimension, especially a particular
type of bias, it is often challenging to isolate the bias of interest from other confounding factors
such as additional biases or general quality-related characteristics. For instance, in the case of
position bias, lengthening the response could potentially alter the style, fluency, and coherence, or
even introduce new biases such as self-enhancement bias. Additionally,      theis LLM-as-a

data [142, 206, 217]; quantitative analysts can utilize LLMs to forecast market movements and

laws and precedents, aiding in the adjudication of legal cases. These emerging applications further

demonstrate the adaptability of LLM evaluators, opening pathways toward broader integration
in practice. This section systematically reviews these domains, outlining how LLM-as-a-Judge
contributes to reliable and scalable evaluation in each.

5.1   Machine Learning
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful evaluative tools across a wide range
of machine learning (ML) tasks, giving rise to the paradigm of “LLM-as-a-Judge”. This approach
leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs not only to generate
responses or predictions, but also to assess, critique, and compare model outputs in various scenarios.
Applications span classic NLP tasks, text generation, reasoning and procedural tasks, information
retrieval, as well as more recent advances in social intelligence and multi-modal understanding.
In the following, we categorize the main areas where LLM-as-a-Judge has been actively applied
within machine learning, and analyze the unique requirements and challenges encountered in each
domain.

5.1.1 NLP. LLMs have been successfully employed as evaluators in several NLP tasks, including
sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text summarization. In sentiment analysis, numerous
biases influencing LLM-based judgments have been identified, prompting the creation of automated
frameworks to systematically quantify these biases.

   Text Generation. Text generation tasks, such as dialog response generation, summarization,
story creation, and creative writing, require content that is safe, accurate, and contextually relevant,
though there isn’t a single "correct" answer [6, 9]. Unlike traditional metrics-based evaluations,
LLM-as-a-judge offers a nuanced, adaptable, and customized assessment. According to Zheng et al.
[213], LLMs like GPT-4 can evaluate text generation comparably to humans. This method has
been used to evaluate outputs from single models and to compare multiple models in competitive
settings. For instance, Gao et al. [38] employ ChatGPT for human-like summarization evaluation,
while Wu et al. [169] propose a comparison-based framework where LLMs act as judges to evaluate
summarization quality.
   Modern LLMs excel at generating detailed, long-form responses, but longer outputs increase
the risk of hallucinations. To address this, Cheng et al. [21] and Zhang et al. [198] use GPT-4 to
identify logically structured yet nonsensical statements. Additionally, Wang et al. [152] propose
a critique-based system to evaluate hallucinations by selecting relevant evidence and providing
detailed critiques. Beyond hallucinations, generating harmful or unsafe responses is a significant
concern. To tackle this, Li et al. [80] introduce MD-Judge and MCQ-Judge for evaluating safety-
related QA pairs, focusing on queries designed to provoke unsafe responses. However, an overly
cautious approach can lead to excessive refusal responses, affecting user experience. To explore
this, Xie et al. [172] conduct a meta-evaluation of various LLM-as-a-judge frameworks, assessing
refusal tendencies in response to potentially unsafe queries. Additionally, Yu et al. [189] introduce
an LLM-based answer extractor to accurately identify critical parts of answers in text generation,
and An et al. [2] propose L-Eval, a framework for standardized evaluation of long-context language
models, followed by Bai et al. [7] who use LLM-as-a-judge to filter evaluation data for long-context
LLMs.
   Recent studies have also used LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the general capabilities of generative
models through debate-based frameworks. For example, Chan et al. [15] introduce a multi-agent
debate framework to facilitate autonomous discussions and assess the quality of generated responses
in tasks. Similarly, Moniri et al. [106] propose an automated debate framework to evaluate LLMs
on domain knowledge, problem definition, and inconsistency recognition.

                                                                        J. Gu, X. Jiang, Z. Shi, J. Guo, et al.


   Reasoning. Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can overcome the limitations of
scaling laws, unlocking their full potential. Effective reasoning is essential for tackling complex
problems, making informed decisions, and delivering accurate, context-aware responses. Wei et al.
[167] introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to facilitate step-by-step reasoning. More
sophisticated cognitive structures [43, 182] have been proposed to further enhance reasoning,
yet selecting a reliable reasoning path remains a significant challenge. LLM-as-a-judge has been
employed to address this issue.
   Some studies focus on sample-level reasoning path selection. Gao et al. [36] present a strategy
evaluator for assessing candidate strategies. Kawabata and Sugawara [60] propose REPS (Rationale
Enhancement through Pairwise Selection), which uses pairwise self-evaluation to select valid
rationales. Lahoti et al. [71] demonstrate that LLMs can identify and enhance response diversity by
aggregating multiple critiques. In multi-agent frameworks, Liang et al. [83] introduce multi-agent
debating (MAD), where a judge LLM selects the most reasonable response. Similarly, Li et al. [76]
utilize a judge LLM in layer-based multi-agent collaboration to improve response quality and
efficiency.
   For step-level reasoning path selection, LLMs act as process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate
state scores. Creswell et al. [23] break down reasoning into Selection and Inference, using LLMs to
judge potential reasoning traces. Xie et al. [173] propose the Kwai-STaR framework, transforming
LLMs into state-transition reasoners for mathematical reasoning. Lightman et al. [84] train LLMs as
PRMs for inference-time supervision and best-of-N sampling. Setlur et al. [124] introduce process
advantage verifiers (PAVs) to generate rewards based on the likelihood of future correct responses.
Advanced cognitive structures are also simulated; Hao et al. [43] use LLMs as a world model
with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for deliberate path selection. Besta et al. [10] model LLM
outputs as graphs to evaluate coherence and logical reasoning. Additionally, critique-based LLM
judges [4, 72, 184, 194] provide detailed feedback to enhance the reasoning process.
   Yao et al. [183] pioneered the use of LLMs in an interleaved manner to generate reasoning
traces and task-specific actions. Reasoning traces guide the model in updating action plans, while
actions facilitate interaction with external sources. Building on this, Yang et al. [180] introduced
Auto-GPT, which leverages LLM-as-a-judge to enhance tool usage accuracy. By integrating a variety
of external tools, LLMs become more versatile, improving planning performance through judicious
tool selection. Sha et al. [125] explored the potential of LLMs in decision-making for complex
autonomous driving scenarios, requiring human-like commonsense reasoning. Zhou et al. [220]
employed a self-discovery process where LLMs judge queries and select the most suitable reasoning
structure for subsequent inference.

   Retrieval. The role of LLM-as-a-judge in retrieval encompasses both traditional document
ranking and dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches. In traditional retrieval,
LLMs enhance ranking accuracy through advanced prompting techniques, enabling effective
document ordering with minimal labeled data. RAG frameworks leverage LLMs’ ability to generate
content guided by retrieved information, supporting applications requiring complex or evolving
knowledge integration.
   Recent studies have explored LLMs as judges for document ranking, aiming to boost precision
and reduce reliance on extensive training data. Zhuang et al. [223] embed fine-grained relevance
labels within LLM prompts, enabling models to distinguish subtle relevance variations for refined
document ordering. Innovations in listwise ranking include Ma et al. [102]’s Listwise Reranker
with a Large Language Model (LRL), which reorders document identifiers without task-specific
training data. Zhuang et al. [224] introduce a Setwise prompting strategy for zero-shot ranking,
enhancing efficiency without sacrificing performance. To address positional biases, Tang et al. [141]

, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


propose permutation self-consistency, averaging multiple list orders to yield order-independent
rankings. Qin et al. [112] critique pointwise and listwise ranking prompts, proposing Pairwise
Ranking Prompting (PRP) with medium-sized, open-source LLMs as a cost-efficient alternative to
larger models.
   Recent advancements in RAG have explored LLMs’ capacity for self-evaluation and improvement
without annotated datasets or parameter adjustments. Tang et al. [140] propose Self-Retrieval, con-
solidating information retrieval within a single LLM using natural language indexing, transforming
retrieval into a document generation and self-assessment process. In question answering, LLMs are
increasingly used as evaluative agents. Rackauckas et al. [114] introduce an LLM-based evaluation
framework generating synthetic queries from user interactions and domain-specific documents,
with LLMs evaluating retrieved documents and ranking RAG agent variants via RAGElo. Zhang
et al. [199] study LLMs’ ability to assess relevance versus utility in open-domain QA, demonstrating
effective distinction and adaptability with counterfactual passages.
   Domain-specific RAG systems reveal LLMs’ potential to navigate complex queries by integrating
specialized knowledge structures. Wang et al. [153] present BIORAG, enhancing vector retrieval
with hierarchical knowledge structures and a self-aware evaluated retriever. Li et al. [77] introduce
DALK, combining an LLM with a continuously evolving Alzheimer’s Disease knowledge graph,
using self-aware knowledge retrieval for noise filtering. Jeong et al. [53] propose Self-BioRAG,
adapting RAG principles to biomedical applications Liu et al. [92], with LLMs selecting the best
evidence for answer generation.
   Within NLP, especially for tasks such as text generation, reasoning and retrieval, LLM-as-a-
Judge enables flexible, scalable, and human-aligned evaluation. However, the open-endedness and
diversity of NLP tasks (such as dialog or story generation) mean that the requirements for judgment
reliability often focus on robustness to context, avoidance of hallucinations, and sensitivity to subtle
errors or biases. In domains such as safety or factuality evaluation, higher reliability is needed due
to the risk of generating unsafe or misleading content. This specificity raises demands for both the
reasoning ability and the transparency of the LLM judge, as highlighted by the increasing focus on
critique-based and meta-evaluations.

5.1.2 Social Intelligence. As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to grow,
they are increasingly being applied to tasks that require nuanced social understanding—abilities
traditionally considered uniquely human. Social intelligence encompasses a range of competencies,
including the interpretation of social contexts, adherence to ethical and cultural norms, under-
standing of emotional cues, and participation in multi-turn interactions that involve negotiation,
persuasion, or empathy. Evaluating these capabilities requires moving beyond conventional aca-
demic benchmarks toward more interactive and context-sensitive frameworks.
   Recent studies have begun to systematically explore the social intelligence of LLMs. For ex-
ample, Xu et al. [175] conduct a comprehensive assessment comparing LLMs’ social reasoning
skills with their performance on academic tasks. Their findings indicate that although LLMs have
made substantial progress in structured problem-solving, they still lag significantly in social in-
telligence relative to human standards. To facilitate more nuanced evaluation, Zhou et al. [221]
developed SOTOPIA, a simulated environment where multiple LLM-based agents interact in rich
social scenarios with assigned goals and social constraints. The accompanying evaluation frame-
work, SOTOPIA-EVAL, employs GPT-4 as an automated judge to assess the agents’ performance
on dimensions such as goal achievement, financial decision-making, and maintenance of social
relationships. This line of research highlights both the potential and the limitations of current
LLMs in replicating human-like social reasoning and interaction. Zhang et al. [196] introduces
“Agent-as-a-Judge,” a scalable framework in which large language models are instructed to act as

sentient evaluators of multi-agent social interactions. By embedding LLMs in role-playing scenarios
that demand theory-of-mind, empathy, and conflict resolution, the study shows that GPT-4-based
judges correlate strongly with human ratings (r = 0.83) on higher-order social cognition tasks,
while also revealing systematic biases that increase with agent anonymity.
   Further efforts are being made to refine evaluation protocols and expand the scope of social
intelligence benchmarks. Some researchers are incorporating human-in-the-loop evaluations to
calibrate automated judgments, while others are designing more diverse cultural and linguistic
scenarios to test cross-cultural adaptability. These developments are critical for deploying LLMs
in applications such as virtual assistants, educational tools, and interactive entertainment, where
social alignment is essential for user trust and engagement.

5.1.3 Multi-Modal Evaluation. The emergence of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
that integrate text with visual, auditory, and other sensory inputs has created a need for robust
evaluation frameworks capable of assessing cross-modal understanding and generation. Multi-
modal evaluation introduces unique challenges such as modality alignment, semantic consistency
across domains, and the integration of contextual information from heterogeneous sources.
   Several recent benchmarks have been developed to address these challenges. Chen et al. [17]
introduced a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on tasks including image captioning,
visual question answering, and mathematical reasoning with visual inputs. Their study revealed
that while LLM-based judges perform well in pairwise comparisons—often matching human
preferences—they struggle with absolute scoring and batch ranking tasks, where consistency and
calibration are more difficult to achieve. In the context of non-English modalities, Wu et al. [170]
presented a benchmark focused on Chinese multi-modal alignment, identifying specific challenges
related to coherence and reasoning. They proposed a calibrated evaluation model that significantly
improves judgment consistency over existing systems.
   To increase transparency in multi-modal evaluations, Xiong et al. [174] explored the use of LLM-
as-a-judge to not only score model outputs but also generate natural language rationales explaining
each assessment. This dual approach improves the interpretability of model judgments and helps
developers identify failure modes. In a specialized application, Chen et al. [20] constructed the
first benchmark for evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) on self-driving corner cases.
Their results demonstrate that LLM-based judges correlate more closely with human evaluations
than judgments provided by LVLMs themselves, underscoring the generalizability of text-based
judges even in vision-dominated tasks.
   Surveying broader trends, Jiang et al. [54] reviewed advancements in multi-modal and multi-
agent systems, highlighting mechanisms designed to enhance inter-agent collaboration and reduce
cognitive bias. Ongoing research is extending multi-modal evaluation to dynamic video content,
audio-visual integration, and embodied AI environments, where temporal and interactive dimen-
sions further complicate assessment. These efforts collectively contribute to more reliable, scalable,
and human-aligned evaluation paradigms for multi-modal AI systems.

5.2 Other Specific Domains
5.2.1 Finance. LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in the finance domain, particularly
in tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, and personalized text generation [209]. As financial
applications frequently require rigorous evaluations with high stakes, there is an increasing demand
for reliable and transparent LLM-based evaluators tailored to financial contexts.
   Current research on LLM-as-a-Judge applications in finance primarily falls into three main areas.
Firstly, considerable efforts have focused on designing evaluators that effectively incorporate expert
domain knowledge. For instance, Brief et al. [13] investigated multi-task fine-tuning techniques

specifically developed to improve LLM performance in finance-related assessments. Similarly, Yu
et al. [190] introduced FinCon, a multi-agent system that utilises conceptual verbal reinforcement
from an LLM-based evaluator to support financial decision-making processes.
   Secondly, developing robust benchmarks and evaluation frameworks constitutes a major area of
research. Representative efforts include UCFE, a financial evaluation benchmark based on user feed-
back [181]; IndoCareer, a dataset consisting of professional financial examination questions [67];
and AI-generated, domain-specific evaluation sets designed to systematically assess LLMs’ under-
standing of financial knowledge and reasoning abilities [117].
   Thirdly, targeted research addresses specific application scenarios within finance, including
quantitative investment strategies, credit scoring, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)
scoring. Wang et al. [157] proposed the QuantAgent framework, which employs a dual-LLM iterative
loop to refine trading signals. In this architecture, one LLM generates initial trading ideas, while a
second LLM rigorously evaluates and iteratively improves these ideas using quantitative metrics
such as the information coefficient and Sharpe ratio (see Figure 15). Additionally, recent studies have
demonstrated promising LLM-based evaluators for credit scoring [5, 187] and ESG scoring [209],
further highlighting the broad potential of LLMs in financial applications.
   Despite these advancements, current applications remain in their early stages, constrained by
several critical limitations. Ensuring factual accuracy and consistent judgments is challenging,
particularly when navigating complex financial regulations or rapidly evolving market data. Addi-
tionally, LLMs primarily excel in qualitative assessments and textual analysis—such as reviewing
financial news or reports—and currently cannot autonomously perform quantitative tasks such
as portfolio optimization or high-frequency trading. As such, their role remains predominantly
auxiliary.
   In summary, LLM-as-a-Judge applications in finance are in an emergent phase, showing promise
in qualitative analysis but limited by inconsistencies in handling dynamic market data and regulatory
complexities. Users demand high reliability in the form of factual accuracy and consistent judgments
to mitigate financial risks, echoing broader challenges in bias mitigation and robustness discussed
earlier in this survey. As such, integrating domain-specific validation will be key to building trust
and enabling scalable deployment.
5.2.2 Law. LLMs have shown growing capabilities in providing professional advice in specialized
fields such as legal consultation, particularly excelling in tasks like text summarization and legal
reasoning. Given the complexity, sensitivity, and societal importance of legal decisions, the legal

                                                                                                                  , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.

domain exhibits heightened concerns regarding potential biases, factual inaccuracies, and trans-
parency challenges inherent in LLM-based evaluators. Thus, rigorous evaluation methodologies
are imperative for responsible deployment in this context.
   Current research on LLM-as-a-Judge applications in the legal domain can be categorized into
two main areas. Firstly, considerable efforts are devoted to developing specialized evaluators that
directly incorporate expert legal knowledge and practices. For example, Ma et al. [101] employ
general LLMs with expert-designed few-shot prompts to simulate the annotation process, effectively
identifying legally relevant facts and precedents. This demonstrates the potential of automated
judicial evaluators. Cheong et al. [22] propose a comprehensive four-dimensional framework for
developing responsible LLM-driven legal advice systems. This framework explicitly considers user
characteristics, query specificity, AI capabilities, and broader social implications, emphasising the
need for a nuanced and context-aware approach to LLM integration in legal practice. Similarly,
Ryu et al. [119] introduce Eval-RAG, a retrieval-augmented evaluator designed to validate LLM-
generated legal texts. In experiments involving Korean legal question-answering tasks, Eval-RAG
achieved closer alignment with human expert judgements than conventional evaluation methods,
reinforcing the value of integrating domain-specific retrieval mechanisms.
   Secondly, the development of comprehensive benchmarks and evaluation datasets represents a
crucial research area, aiming to systematically measure and improve LLM legal reasoning capabili-
ties. Representative examples include multi-domain datasets such as IndoCareer, which contains
professional legal examination questions [67], and LegalBench, a collaborative benchmark specif-
ically designed to assess legal reasoning skills across multiple jurisdictions and languages [41].
Additionally, language-specific benchmarks have been developed, including LexEval for evaluating
Chinese legal texts [78] and Eval-RAG for Korean legal contexts [119]. In addition to evaluating
technical reasoning abilities, targeted benchmarks have also been introduced to assess ethically
sensitive aspects of legal advice, such as ethical reasoning [204] and the potential harmfulness
or biases present in generated outputs [3], highlighting the complexity and sensitivity of LLM
evaluation in the legal domain.
   Despite these advancements, significant gaps and limitations persist, restricting the widespread
adoption of LLMs in the legal domain. Legal reasoning inherently requires precision, transparency,
and strict adherence to established statutes and case precedents. However, current LLMs are still
prone to factual hallucinations and may overlook subtle but legally significant distinctions. Bias
is also a major concern. LLMs trained on large-scale datasets may unintentionally incorporate
societal biases, leading to unfair or skewed legal judgments, especially in sensitive cases involving
ethics or human rights. Additionally, due to the complexity and variability of jurisdiction-specific
legal frameworks, general-purpose LLMs often struggle to capture nuanced differences without
detailed contextualization and additional guidance.
   Future research should prioritize addressing these limitations through targeted innovations.
Promising directions include enhancing factual reliability by integrating robust legal databases
and retrieval mechanisms, thereby enabling real-time cross-verification of LLM-generated outputs
against authoritative legal sources. Another important avenue is the development of bias mitigation
strategies, such as selective filtering of training data or calibration processes guided by expert
legal annotations. Crucially, greater interpretability and transparency will be essential. Future
LLM judges should ideally provide explicit rationales, relevant statutory references, and coherent
justifications for each decision. Ultimately, close collaboration between AI developers and legal
professionals will be vital to navigating regulatory frameworks, ensuring ethical compliance, and
facilitating the responsible deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems within legal contexts.

A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


5.2.3 AI for Science. LLMs have demonstrated notable potential in scientific fields, particularly
in domains such as medicine and mathematics, where they increasingly act as evaluators to enhance
accuracy and consistency [142, 210, 219].
   Current research on LLM-as-a-Judge in science can be grouped into three major directions. First,
specialized evaluators are being crafted for high-stakes clinical reasoning. Brake and Schaaf [12]
showed that a LLaMA-2 evaluator attains human-level agreement (Cohen’s 𝜅 =0.79) when check-
ing the internal consistency of clinical notes, while Krolik et al. [68] reported similarly strong
performance for judging medical Q&A responses. Hosseini et al. [46] released the first public
benchmark targeting long-form medical QA; their study found that open-weight LLMs acting
as judges correlate well with physician ratings on criteria such as correctness, helpfulness and
harmfulness.
   Second, mathematics research has embraced step-wise reward modeling to verify reasoning
chains. WizardMath applies Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback and surpasses
GPT-3.5 on GSM8K and MATH [99]. Building on this idea, Math-Shepherd introduces an automatic
process-reward model that verifies each reasoning step without human annotations and then
reinforces the solver, boosting Mistral-7B accuracy to 84.1 % on GSM8K [156]. Tong et al. proposed
DART-Math, a difficulty-aware rejection-tuning pipeline that focuses training on hard problems
and achieves state-of-the-art results across six math benchmarks [146]. For multimodal scenarios,
Lu et al. created MathVista to evaluate textual–visual reasoning, revealing persistent weaknesses
when diagrams are involved [97].
   Third, comprehensive benchmarking frameworks are emerging to assess scientific LLM judges at
scale. Nature Medicine’s 2024 review highlighted gaps in automatic metrics and advocated clinician-
in-the-loop pipelines for summarization tasks [151]. Stanford HAI’s MedHELM introduced a holistic
evaluation suite covering eleven clinical tasks and showed that even top commercial models still
lag on medication-safety questions [64]. In mathematics, Xia et al. [171] built a logic-coherence
judge that scores entire proof trajectories rather than final answers, providing richer diagnostic
signals.
   Limitations and future directions. Despite rapid progress, current medical evaluators often rely
on exam-style or short-form outputs and struggle with real-world clinical complexity; hallucination
detection remains an open problem [64]. Math-centric judges are still brittle on open-ended or
multimodal problems, and exhaustive step verification is computationally costly. Future work should
fuse LLM judges with symbolic solvers or medical knowledge bases for fact-checking, incorporate
uncertainty estimation (e.g. calibrated refusals), and design multimodal-aware judges capable of
interpreting figures and tables. Finally, establishing public, diverse scientific benchmarks—paired
with transparent reporting of failure cases—will be crucial for trustworthy deployment of LLM-as-
a-Judge systems in scientific research and practice.
   In summary, the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm in scientific domains is progressing rapidly, supported
by specialised evaluators and benchmarks. However, its uptake remains limited by multimodal
constraints and the high cost of verification in complex settings. Reliability requirements therefore
centre on hallucination detection and evidence-based rigour to maintain scientific validity, echoing
the survey’s discussion of output consistency and adversarial robustness. Integrating large language
models with structured knowledge bases is likely to meet these high-stakes needs for precise,
verifiable judgements.

5.2.4 Others. LLMs have also been employed as evaluators to enhance efficiency and consistency
across various fields. In software engineering, a method was proposed for using LLMs to evaluate
bug report summarizations, demonstrating high accuracy in assessing correctness and complete-
ness, even surpassing human evaluators who experienced fatigue [69]. This approach offers a

scalable solution for evaluation. In education, automated essay scoring and revising have been
explored using open-source LLMs, achieving performance comparable to traditional deep-learning
models. Techniques such as few-shot learning and prompt tuning improved scoring accuracy, while
revisions effectively enhanced essay quality without compromising original meaning [132]. In
content moderation, an LLM-based approach was developed to identify rule violations on platforms
like Reddit, achieving high true-negative rates but encountering challenges with complex rule
interpretation, emphasizing the necessity of human oversight for nuanced cases [65]. In behavioral
sciences, the LLM-as-a-Judge framework was evaluated for assessing user preferences based on
personas, revealing limitations in reliability and consistency due to oversimplified personas, but
improved significantly through verbal uncertainty estimation, achieving high agreement with
human evaluations for high-certainty cases [30]. These applications of LLMs as evaluators highlight
their growing potential in diverse sectors, emphasizing the need for integrating domain-specific
knowledge and refining methodologies.
   Moreover, LLMs as evaluators demonstrate significant advantages in qualitative assessments
that are difficult to quantify, such as evaluating service quality, analyzing user experience feedback,
and assessing creative content like art or literature reviews. LLMs’ capability to understand and
generate nuanced language makes them well-suited for subjective evaluation tasks traditionally
requiring human judgment. Future research will focus more on these areas, exploring how LLMs as
judges can enhance assessment accuracy and consistency where traditional quantitative methods
fall short.
   In summary, the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm is gaining traction across domains such as software
engineering, education and behavioural science, where it enables scalable qualitative assessment.
Nevertheless, its deployment is constrained by context-specific inconsistencies and by the difficulty
of replacing fatigued human reviewers. Reliability requirements differ by field. They often centre
on the consistent interpretation of nuanced rules or subjective preferences so as to minimise
bias, echoing the survey’s broader themes of prompt optimisation and self-consistency. Therefore,
domain-specific adaptation will be essential to satisfy these varied demands and to support reliable,
efficient applications.

6     CHALLENGES
In this chapter, we explore the key challenges that arise when utilizing LLMs for evaluation
tasks, particularly in the context of LLM-as-a-Judge. Despite their growing capabilities, LLMs still
face significant issues related to reliability, robustness, and their backbone models’ limitations.
Understanding these challenges is crucial for advancing the use of LLMs in a fair, consistent,
and reliable manner. We address these concerns under four main themes: reliability, robustness,
powerful backbone models, and the ethical and social implications of their use.

6.1    Reliability
The reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge is a primary concern, as it directly impacts the consistency and
fairness of evaluations. While human judges also exhibit inherent biases, LLMs introduce their own
unique set of reliability issues. These issues stem from the probabilistic nature of the models and
their sensitivity to input nuances. We can further break down reliability challenges into several
key areas.
   In-Context Learning Sensitivity. LLMs’ in-context learning ability, where a model learns from
examples in a prompt, can introduce significant reliability issues. Minor changes in prompt wording
or the order of examples can lead to unstable and inconsistent results. For instance, position bias
is a well-documented issue where LLMs tend to favor the first or last response in a list, leading

A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


to unfair evaluations if the examples are poorly arranged. Similarly, the inherent randomness of
an LLM’s generation can cause inconsistent inter-rater reliability, where the model gives different
scores for the same input.
   Overconfidence and Self-Enhancement. A major issue is overconfidence, where models,
particularly those trained with Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), may offer
overly favorable scores for their own responses, leading to misleading evaluations. This is often
tied to self-enhancement bias, where an LLM is more likely to give a higher score to an answer
it generated itself compared to an equivalent answer generated by a different model.
  Model Selection and Generalization. The choice of LLM itself significantly impacts evaluation
dependability. The black-box nature and version dependency of commercial models like GPT-4
hinder reproducibility. While fine-tuned evaluators may seem like a solution, they often exhibit
overfitting, meaning their evaluation capabilities may not generalize well beyond their training
data. These models can also inherit subtle biases from their training datasets, necessitating careful
meta-evaluation to ensure fairness.

6.2   Robustness
The robustness of LLM-as-a-Judge refers to its ability to resist adversarial attacks and inconsistent
inputs. While attacks on traditional Natural Language Generation (NLG) models are well-studied,
attacks on LLM-as-a-Judge are relatively under-explored. These attacks aim to exploit a judge
model’s biases, inconsistencies, or loopholes to manipulate its decision-making process.
   Adversarial Attacks. Unlike traditional attacks that aim to make a model generate harmful
content, attacks on LLM-as-a-Judge aim to subtly manipulate the input to change the evaluation
outcome. For example, an attacker could introduce imperceptible perturbations to the text—such
as paraphrasing a key sentence or adding a misleading but grammatically correct phrase—to trick
the judge model into a different conclusion. These attacks are particularly insidious because the
manipulated input appears harmless to a human but can cause a significant deviation in the LLM’s
judgment.
   Input Sensitivity and Jailbreaking. LLM judges are also susceptible to jailbreaking tech-
niques. An attacker could craft a prompt that bypasses the model’s safety and fairness filters,
causing it to produce a biased or inconsistent evaluation. The model might be prompted to take on
a "persona" with specific prejudices, leading to skewed judgments. This is a significant concern for
open-source LLM judges, which may not have the same level of fine-tuning for safety as proprietary
models.
   Brittleness of Scoring Mechanisms. The reliance on specific scoring formats can be a point
of weakness. If a prompt requires an exact numerical score (e.g., "rate on a scale of 1-5"), a clever
attacker could create input that confuses the model, causing it to output text instead of a number,
thus breaking the automated scoring pipeline. This brittleness undermines the reliability and
automation of the entire evaluation system.

6.3   Limitations of Backbone Models
The effectiveness of any LLM-as-a-Judge system is directly tied to its underlying backbone model’s
capabilities. A primary bottleneck lies in the lack of robust models that can serve as reliable
judges for complex, multimodal content. While powerful in text, current multimodal LLMs like
GPT-4 Vision still struggle with sophisticated reasoning that integrates different modalities. For
example, in a medical context, a judge model might need to evaluate a diagnosis based on both a

                                                       , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
                                                                         J. Gu, X. Jiang, Z. Shi, J. Guo, et al.


textual description of symptoms and an image of an X-ray. A flawed model could miss a subtle but
critical inconsistency between the two, leading to an inaccurate judgment. This limitation poses a
significant challenge to achieving reliable evaluations in a wide range of real-world scenarios.
   Even for purely text-based tasks, current LLMs have limitations in abstract and causal reasoning.
When evaluating a response that requires a deep understanding of logical consistency, a model
might produce a seemingly confident but fundamentally flawed evaluation. For instance, in judging
a complex scientific paper or legal argument, the model may give a high score for stylistic fluency
while failing to identify a subtle but fundamental flaw in the logical chain or causal argument.
This gap between the model’s superficial fluency and its true reasoning depth undermines trust
in its ability to handle sophisticated analytical processes and highlights the need for more robust
reasoning backbones.

6.4    Interpretability and Transparency of Judgments
While current LLM-as-a-Judge systems can provide seemingly reasonable scores or conclusions
for many tasks, their evaluation process is often an opaque black box. This lack of transparency
significantly limits user trust and constrains the application in high-stakes domains such as medicine,
law, and education. For instance, in a legal context, an LLM judge might accurately summarize a
case and suggest a verdict, but it cannot explicitly show which case precedents it referenced or
which legal statutes it prioritized in its reasoning process. This is fundamentally different from
human lawyers, who can always provide a traceable rationale for their judgment. A core challenge,
therefore, lies in developing methods that can make the reasoning behind LLM-based judgments
explicit and verifiable, allowing human experts to trace and validate the model’s logic path.

6.5    Meta-Evaluation and Temporal Consistency
Existing research predominantly focuses on assessing the LLM-as-a-Judge’s evaluation results on
a specific task, while rarely subjecting the "evaluator itself" to systematic scrutiny. This creates
a critical gap, as we lack rigorous benchmarks to measure a judge’s accuracy, stability, and bias.
This raises a new research imperative: how do we evaluate the evaluator, thereby ensuring the
reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems? Furthermore, extensive empirical evidence suggests that
the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge is not static, with its judgments potentially drifting over time
due to model updates or contextual changes. For example, a response to a controversial topic
might be rated as acceptable by a model version from March, but subsequently penalized by a June
version due to new safety fine-tuning. This "evaluation drift," a type of temporal unreliability, is
a particularly pronounced issue in practical scenarios where users demand consistent and stable
standards over the long term, ultimately undermining trust and raising concerns about fairness.

6.6    Ethical and Social Implications
Beyond technical challenges, the use of LLM-as-a-Judge raises critical ethical and social questions
that must be addressed.
   Bias Amplification. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of internet data, which often contains
societal biases related to gender, race, and other demographics. When used as judges, these models
can amplify and perpetuate these biases, leading to unfair evaluations. For instance, a model might
unfairly penalize a response written in a non-standard English dialect or a writing style associated
with a marginalized group. This has profound social implications, especially in high-stakes areas
like hiring or content moderation.
   Lack of Accountability and Transparency. The "black box" nature of proprietary LLMs makes
it difficult to understand how they arrive at a specific evaluation. When an evaluation is deemed

, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


unfair or incorrect, there is no clear way to trace the error or hold the model accountable. This lack
of transparency undermines trust in the evaluation process and can be particularly problematic
in fields where human oversight and accountability are paramount.
   Impact on Creative and Diverse Outputs. By acting as a judge, an LLM can inadvertently
shape the types of content being produced. If a model consistently favors a certain style, format,
or tone, it could stifle creative and diverse outputs, leading to a homogenization of content. This
phenomenon, known as evaluation-driven convergence, could harm innovation and reduce the
richness of the information ecosystem.

7     FUTURE WORK
The field of LLM-as-a-Judge is rapidly evolving, moving from an emerging concept to a core
component of modern AI development. While we’ve seen significant progress in using LLMs for
evaluation, there are still critical challenges and vast opportunities to explore. This section outlines
key future research directions that are essential for building more reliable, versatile, and impactful
LLM-as-a-Judge systems. We’ll delve into topics ranging from advancing the foundational reasoning
and judgment capabilities of these models to expanding their application into new domains like data
annotation and embodied intelligence. Our discussion also focuses on the necessity of developing
more robust theoretical frameworks and benchmarks to ensure these systems are not only effective
but also trustworthy and aligned with human values. This forward-looking agenda aims to guide
the next generation of research, paving the way for LLM-as-a-Judge to become an indispensable
tool in the pursuit of more intelligent and socially beneficial AI.

7.1    Reasoning-Centric Judgement
Moving forward, Moving forward, the field is transitioning from traditional evaluation methods to a
reasoning-centric approach made possible by LLM-as-a-Judge. We will first examine the symbiotic
relationship between reasoning and judgment, highlighting how their synergy is essential for
creating sophisticated and capable AI systems. Next, we will discuss how the integration of LLM-
as-a-Judge into dynamic feedback loops enables continuous self-improvement, which is key to
advancing model capabilities. We conclude with the long-term vision of Self-Evolving Judges, which
can adapt and refine their own evaluative abilities over time.

7.1.1 The Synergy Between Judgment and Reasoning. As shown in Figure 16, reasoning and
judgment are two deeply connected yet distinct cognitive abilities. Reasoning is the logical process
of drawing conclusions from evidence or premises. It’s the engine that powers problem-solving,
decision-making, and critical analysis. In contrast, judgment is the act of evaluating something—an

          The Development of Evaluation Method

idea, an output, or a situation—against a set of standards or principles to determine its quality or
validity. This distinction is crucial, but their relationship is symbiotic.
   The philosopher Immanuel Kant famously described judgment as “the faculty of thinking the
particular as contained under the universal.” In the context of LLMs, this means applying a general
rule or set of principles (the "universal") to a specific output (the "particular") to determine its
quality. For example, an LLM-as-a-Judge might evaluate a generated summary against the universal
principles of conciseness, accuracy, and coherence. The relationship between these two functions
is not one-way; they are mutually reinforcing. Reasoning depends on judgment to validate its
intermediate steps. As a model works through a complex problem, it needs to evaluate whether
each step in its chain of thought is logical and contributes to a sound final conclusion. This internal
evaluation is a form of judgment. Conversely, effective judgment requires strong reasoning to eval-
uate options against a logical framework. You can’t make a good judgment without understanding
the underlying logic.
   This synergy is at the core of advanced LLM capabilities. When judgment is performed contin-
uously and at a high frequency—for instance, an LLM evaluating every step of its own thought
process—it starts to approximate the process of reasoning itself. The more a model systematically
evaluates and refines its own thought processes, the more it becomes an effective reasoner. This
is why LLM-as-a-Judge is more than just an evaluation tool; it’s a mechanism for enhancing a
model’s reasoning capabilities.

7.1.2 Feedback Loops and Self-Improvement. The true power of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
is unleashed when it is integrated into a feedback loop that enables continuous self-improvement.
A prime example is OpenAI’s o1 model, which demonstrates enhanced problem-solving ability
through structured, iterative reasoning. A central component of o1’s advancement is the use of LLM-
as-a-Judge modules that evaluate reasoning paths at each stage, offering feedback that improves
future steps. This allows the model to correct inconsistencies, identify simpler decompositions of
complex problems, and progressively refine its outputs.
   This dynamic feedback mechanism operates in two key modes:

, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


  (1) Training-Time Evaluation: During the training phase, an LLM-as-a-Judge provides feed-
      back on a model’s reasoning process. This feedback is integrated into learning objectives, for
      example, via RLHF or a similar mechanism. By learning from its mistakes and successes, the
      model internalizes better reasoning strategies that generalize across tasks.
  (2) Inference-Time Evaluation: During the testing or deployment phase, the LLM-as-a-Judge
      dynamically evaluates the model’s reasoning as it’s happening. This real-time feedback allows
      the model to make on-the-fly corrections, refining its output and leading to better results
      without the need for additional training.
This continuous loop of reasoning → judgment → refinement closely mirrors the principles of
Constitutional AI, a framework where models are trained to self-critique and self-correct based
on a set of predefined principles. For example, in models like DeepSeek-R1, the LLM acts as its own
judge, refining its decisions through internal assessments. This self-generated feedback loop helps
the model improve without needing external verification. By integrating LLM-as-a-Judge within
such feedback-rich frameworks, models gain the ability to not only evaluate external content but
also to introspect and evolve their own reasoning processes. This represents a significant step
toward building AI systems that are capable of LLM optimization and self-improvement over time.
7.1.3 Self-Evolving Judges. A long-term vision is to enable LLM-as-a-Judge systems to possess
self-calibration and self-correction abilities. This would involve evaluators that can continuously
refine their biases based on external feedback, thus evolving into more reliable "evaluation agents"
over time. This direction aligns with the emerging idea of "World Model-as-a-Judge," as shown
in Figure 17 where an AI system can use its internal models of the world to make and justify
judgments. For example, a judge could not only evaluate a proposed solution to a problem but also
simulate the consequences of that solution in a hypothetical environment, identifying potential
flaws before they occur. This vision implies that future evaluators will no longer be static tools
but rather dynamic, evolving intelligent systems that can adapt and improve their own judgment
capabilities, marking a significant step towards more autonomous and trustworthy AI.

7.2   Theoretically Grounded Evaluation
Current research on the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge primarily relies on empirical benchmarks, but
it lacks a solid theoretical foundation. As a next step, it is imperative to move beyond these empirical
approaches and establish a more formal theoretical framework for evaluation. Future work should
borrow ideas from fields like statistics and measurement theory to introduce formal definitions
of concepts like consistency and robustness. For instance, researchers could adapt established
metrics such as Cohen’s Kappa or Krippendorff’s Alpha to quantify the inter-rater reliability of
different LLM judges. Such a framework would allow us to systematically characterize and improve
the reliability of these evaluators, moving the field from a trial-and-error approach to one that is
scientifically grounded and allows for verifiable, reproducible results.

7.3   More Reliable LLM-as-a-Judge
As highlighted in our Formulation (§ 2) and Strategy (§ 3), LLMs are probabilistic models that
require extensive research and optimization to enhance their reliability as judges. Although current
methods have improved the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge, many challenges, including adaptability
and robustness, remain unresolved. To enable probabilistic models to deliver evaluations closely
aligned with real-world scenarios, future research should prioritize refining and implementing LLM-
as-a-Judge across the evaluation pipeline. There is considerable potential for improving reliability
in various aspects, including in-context learning, model selection, post-processing techniques,
and the overall evaluation framework for LLM-as-a-Judge. These efforts should prioritize not

only enhancing the reliability of assessments but also developing methodologies to systematically
evaluate and validate the robustness of these assessments. Furthermore, the establishment of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and interpretable analytical tools will be crucial for assessing
and improving the reliability of LLM evaluators. Finally, the uncertain and evolving nature of
robustness risks underscores the necessity of proactive mitigation strategies. These strategies
should include the development of adversarial training techniques tailored to judgment tasks,
the integration of robust uncertainty quantification methods, and the implementation of human-
in-the-loop systems to oversee critical decisions. By addressing these challenges, we can build
more resilient and dependable systems capable of maintaining high levels of reliability even under
adversarial conditions.

7.4    MLLM-as-a-Judge
AI systems are evolving into highly versatile and multifunctional entities [27]. Traditionally, spe-
cialized models were required for distinct language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis,
syntactic parsing, and dialogue modeling. However, large language models (LLMs) have demon-
strated competence across these tasks using a single set of weights [134]. Similarly, advancements
are being made toward unified systems capable of processing multiple data modalities. Instead
of employing distinct architectures for processing text, audio, and images, recent models like
GPT-4o [107], Gemini [40], and LLaVA [90] integrate these capabilities within a single framework.
These developments highlight a growing trend toward unification in the structure and functionality
of AI systems, which extends to the emerging paradigm of LLM-as-a-Judge.
   Currently, MLLM-as-a-Judge frameworks [17] are emerging for evaluating models. However, re-
search exploring how MLLM-as-a-Judge could be applied to the evaluation of data or agents remains
limited. Beyond model evaluation, MLLM-as-a-Judge, much like LLM-as-a-Judge, is envisioned to
have the capability to assess or annotate data, function as a Reward Model, or serve as a Verifier
within intermediate reasoning processes. These expanded roles would allow MLLM-as-a-Judge to
contribute more broadly to the AI pipeline.
   The future of evaluation lies in developing robust multi-modal evaluators capable of reasoning
and assessing complex content spanning text, audio, images, and video. While current multi-modal
LLMs exhibit promising capabilities, they often lack the reasoning depth and reliability of their
text-based counterparts. Future research must address these limitations, with a focus on enhancing
reasoning capabilities, improving reliability, and enabling seamless integration across modalities. A
practical multi-modal evaluator has the potential to not only advance AI research but also enable
new applications in areas such as multi-modal content moderation and automated knowledge
extraction.

7.5    Advancing Evaluation Benchmarks
The development of more comprehensive and rigorous benchmarks is critical for advancing the
reliability and applicability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems. This effort must proceed on two distinct
but interconnected fronts: establishing a framework to evaluate the judge itself and expanding the
scope of what the judge can evaluate.
   Evaluation of the Evaluator (Meta-Evaluation). A critical future direction is the development
of systematic meta-evaluation frameworks designed specifically to test the reliability, fairness, and
consistency of LLM judges. Unlike existing benchmarks that evaluate a model’s performance on a
task, these new frameworks would focus on the evaluator itself. For example, a meta-evaluation
benchmark could include a carefully constructed set of prompts with known adversarial qualities,
such as subtle word substitutions or paraphrasing, to test a judge’s robustness to input perturbations.

, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


Furthermore, these frameworks must be capable of assessing the judge’s stability over time and
across different model versions, thereby tracking and mitigating issues like "evaluation drift." This
type of framework would be model-agnostic, capable of not only quantifying performance but also
providing a basis for explaining a judge’s behavior, which in turn fosters greater transparency and
trust in the system.
   Expanding Benchmark Scope. While meta-evaluation ensures the integrity of the judge, we
must also continue to develop more comprehensive and diverse benchmarks to push the boundaries
of what LLM-as-a-Judge can accomplish. Future efforts could focus on creating high-quality, large-
scale datasets that encompass a wide range of scenarios, including domain-specific applications,
multimodal content, and real-world complexities. For instance, a new benchmark could feature
legal documents and require the judge to evaluate the logical soundness of a legal argument, or
include a combination of images and text, requiring the judge to identify inconsistencies between
them. These benchmarks should also integrate more detailed and fine-grained evaluation metrics
that go beyond simple scores. By establishing rigorous standards and datasets akin to ImageNet in
scale and impact, the LLM-as-a-Judge field can achieve deeper insights into model performance
and accelerate the development of more capable and reliable evaluation methodologies.

7.6   LLM-as-a-Judge for Data Annotation
In contrast, LLM-as-a-judge is a general technique where you use LLM to approximate human
labeling. When you ask an LLM to assess qualities like "faithfulness to source," "correctness," or
"helpfulness," you define what these terms mean in the evaluation prompt and rely on the semantic
relationships the LLM learned from training data. Despite its wide applications, data annotation
poses significant challenges for current machine-learning models due to the complexity, subjectivity,
and diversity of data. This process requires domain expertise and is resource-intensive, particularly
when manually labeling large datasets. Advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 [107], Gemini [40], and
LLaMA-2 [149] offer a promising opportunity to revolutionize data annotation. LLMs serve as more
than just tools but play a crucial role in improving the effectiveness and precision of data annotation.
Their ability to automate annotation tasks [208], ensure consistency across large volumes of data,
and adapt through fine-tuning or prompting for specific domains [101, 131], significantly mitigates
the challenges encountered with traditional annotation methods, setting a new standard for what
is achievable in the realm of NLP.
   Whether in the field of scientific research or industry, we are all still suffering from insufficient
target data and domain-specific data, or situations where the data quality is not high enough.
Assuming that LLM-as-a-judge can achieve stable performance and be fair and reliable, we can
use LLM to annotate data in scenarios where data is insufficient to expand the data. In scenarios
with low data quality, we can assess the data quality through LLM, and label the quality tags to
achieve the goal of selecting high-quality data. Currently, we have not been able to experimentally
rely solely on LLM for a reliable evaluation of various scenarios of data; most of the time, we still
rely on human annotation to ensure professionalism and reliability. LLM-as-a-judge often needs to
learn from human annotations in order to perform certain labeling tasks.

7.7   LLM-as-a-Judge for Scaling
The paradigm of LLM-as-a-Judge is poised to become a core mechanism for scaling AI development,
particularly in an era where models are increasingly trained through interactive and iterative
feedback loops. At its most fundamental level, this involves scaling data annotation. Traditional
human labeling is a major bottleneck, as it is both costly and slow. LLM-as-a-Judge offers a path
to rapidly generate massive, high-quality datasets that would be otherwise impossible to obtain.

                                                         , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
                                                                          J. Gu, X. Jiang, Z. Shi, J. Guo, et al.


For instance, it can be used to generate preference labels for RLHF at a scale that is prohibitive
for human annotators, thus fueling the development of more sophisticated models. The judge can
also be deployed in semi-automated workflows where it provides initial annotations that are then
quickly verified by humans, significantly boosting throughput and efficiency. Beyond static data
creation, the judge can scale the entire model optimization process by acting as an automated critic
or reward model. In multi-agent systems, an LLM judge can evaluate the quality of inter-agent
communication and collaboration in real time, and in optimization pipelines, it can provide nuanced,
dynamic feedback to guide model fine-tuning and enhance reasoning chains, thus serving as a
scalable alternative to traditional, fixed metrics.

7.8    LLM-as-a-Judge for Embodied Intelligence
While LLM-as-a-Judge has primarily focused on evaluating digital outputs like text and images,
its application can be extended to the domain of embodied intelligence. This presents a novel
and complex challenge: judging the actions and behaviors of agents in physical or simulated
environments. Unlike evaluating a text response, judging an embodied agent requires assessing
a sequence of actions, their spatiotemporal relationships, and their alignment with a high-level
goal, which necessitates a deep understanding of physics and cause and effect. For instance, an
LLM judge could evaluate a robot’s performance in a complex task like preparing a meal. The judge
would need to assess not only if the final product is correct, but also if the robot’s movements were
efficient, safe, and followed a logical sequence, such as correctly aligning a cup with a dispenser to
avoid spillage. Similarly, in virtual environments or gaming, an LLM judge could assess an agent’s
strategic ability, navigation skills, or its capacity to solve puzzles in a human-like manner. This
judge would act as a crucial feedback mechanism, providing high-dimensional, natural language
feedback to guide the embodied agent’s learning process. This rich feedback, far more informative
than a simple scalar reward signal, could accelerate learning and lead to more generalizable and
human-aligned intelligent systems.

7.9    LLM-as-a-Judge for LLM Optimization
LLM-as-a-Judge shows substantial promise for advancing LLM optimization. Recent studies [226]
have begun incorporating LLM-as-a-Judge into multi-agent frameworks to guide inter-agent interac-
tions, thereby improving overall decision-making efficiency and quality. In addition, LLM-as-a-Judge
has been employed in Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) pipelines [150], functioning as a crucial scor-
ing module for evaluating the reasoning processes of models. By flexibly adapting to diverse content
formats and domains, LLM-as-a-Judge offers a robust and efficient evaluation mechanism for a
wide range of optimization tasks.
   Despite these encouraging developments, current research efforts are still in their infancy. Future
work should focus on broadening the application domains and strategies for implementing LLM-
as-a-Judge, especially in complex, multi-modal scenarios. Furthermore, a systematic assessment
of its reliability and generalization capabilities will be critical for fully realizing the potential of
LLM-as-a-Judge in enhancing model performance and robustness.

7.10     Domain-Specific Reliable Applications
The reliability requirements for evaluation differ significantly across domains. Future work should
focus on developing customized LLM-as-a-Judge systems tailored for specific application scenarios,
such as medical diagnosis, legal adjudication, educational assessment, and scientific peer review.
This requires more than just adjusting prompts or fine-tuning strategies. For instance, a judge
designed for legal cases must be trained to prioritize strict adherence to legal precedents and statutes,
ensuring its judgments are defensible and auditable. Similarly, a judge for medical diagnosis must

, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: October 2025.
A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge


be rigorously tested on its ability to understand clinical guidelines and interpret medical jargon
correctly. This demands a specialized design concerning evaluation standards, bias control, and
social responsibility to meet the unique needs of each field and earn the trust of domain experts.

8   CONCLUSION
LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising paradigm for automated evaluation, offering scalability
and adaptability that surpass traditional expert-driven or metric-based methods. By leveraging
the reasoning capabilities of large language models, this framework excels in tasks such as text
quality assessment, model evaluation, and automated data annotation. It is particularly valuable for
large-scale, efficient, and adaptable evaluation. Its ability to process diverse content formats and
integrate domain-specific knowledge makes it particularly well-suited for applications in education,
peer review, and decision-making systems.
   Despite these strengths, several challenges must be addressed to fully realize its potential.
Ensuring reliability remains a key issue, because probabilistic outputs can introduce inconsistencies,
overconfidence, and biases inherited from training data. Although techniques RLHF have improved
alignment with human judgment, they do not eliminate all sources of subjectivity. Moreover,
ensuring robustness is another critical concern. LLM-as-a-Judge can be susceptible to adversarial
prompt manipulation and contextual framing biases, potentially causing unintended or unreliable
evaluations. Finally, generalization across domains and modalities remains a significant hurdle, as
current models struggle with evaluating multi-modal inputs, reasoning over structured data, and
adapting to domain-specific evaluation standards.
   To address these challenges, this paper has offered a comprehensive and principled roadmap.
First, at the definitional level, we have provided both formal and informal definitions of LLM-as-a-
Judge, thereby establishing the conceptual boundaries of this paradigm. Critically, we introduced
a contextualized definition of reliability that accounts for input variability, model characteristics,
and contextual dependencies, providing a foundational framework for designing trustworthy
systems. Second, at the framework level, we have brought structure to the fragmented literature
by organizing existing work around four foundational questions: What is LLM-as-a-Judge? How
to use it? How to improve it? and How to evaluate it? This synthesis not only unifies a scattered
body of research but also identifies critical gaps and opportunities for future exploration. Third, at
the empirical level, we have performed comparative analyses of existing approaches and, more
importantly, proposed a novel meta-evaluation benchmark tailored to assess the judge itself. This
empirical contribution facilitates systematic performance assessments, revealing crucial trade-
offs—such as robustness versus sensitivity—and providing actionable insights for constructing
methodologically rigorous and practically deployable evaluation frameworks. Finally, at the
perspective level, we have presented a comprehensive analysis that integrates the applications,
challenges, and future directions of this paradigm. We have shown that LLM-as-a-Judge can serve as
an integral component in high-stakes domains, from finance to law, by identifying unique, domain-
specific reliability requirements. Our forward-looking agenda, which emphasizes theoretically
grounded methodologies, systematic benchmarks for meta-evaluation, and hybrid human–AI
frameworks, aims to guide the community toward LLM-as-a-Judge systems that are not only
technically robust but also epistemically sound, socially trustworthy, and broadly applicable in
critical sectors.
   Ultimately, LLM-as-a-Judge is poised to become an integral component of next-generation evalu-
ation systems, augmenting human expertise rather than replacing it. By addressing the challenges
of reliability, robustness, and generalization, we can create more trustworthy, adaptive, and compre-
hensive evaluators, paving the way for their adoption across scientific research, education, industry,
and beyond.
