# Log

Append-only chronological record of wiki operations. Strict prefix format so `grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md | tail -10` works as a CLI. Format (indented to keep grep clean):

    ## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <title>

Permitted operations: `ingest`, `query`, `lint`, `synthesize`, `refactor`. See [the design doc, §9.2](../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-llm-wiki-design.md#92-wikilogmd) for details.

## [2026-04-28] refactor | scaffold initialized

Initial wiki scaffold built per [the design doc](../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-llm-wiki-design.md). Created `raw/` (articles, papers, lectures, books, images, assets) and `wiki/` (sources, entities, concepts, syntheses, threads) skeletons with `.gitkeep` placeholders, plus this log and a canonical `index.md`. Ready for first source ingest.

## [2026-04-28] refactor | added raw/reports/ and kind: report

Industry reports, government white papers, consultancy decks, and sell-side equity research didn't fit cleanly into `raw/papers/` (academic) or `raw/articles/` (web-clipped markdown). Added `raw/reports/` as a peer of `raw/papers/`, extended the source-page `kind:` enum to include `report`, and added a row to design doc §10 + decision log §18. Sub-types are disambiguated via tags (`consultancy`, `government`, `equity-research`, `ngo`).

## [2026-04-28] refactor | folder placement: MITTRI_Cisco to raw/reports/

Confirmed Anand & Wu's "Gen AI Playbook for Organizations" is HBR (Nov–Dec 2025) → stays in `raw/articles/`. Moved MITTRI_Cisco to `raw/reports/` (sponsored research from MIT Tech Review Insights, not journalism). Final placement of the 6 pre-ingest sources: 3 articles, 1 paper, 2 reports.

## [2026-04-28] ingest | Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025

First real ingest. Maslej et al., Stanford HAI, April 2025, 414 pp, CC BY-ND 4.0. Read in scope: Intro + Top 12 Takeaways + all chapter highlights + Ch 4 Economy in depth (incl. all of §4.4 Corporate Activity and §4.5 Robot Deployments) + Ch 3 RAI skim via highlights and §3.10 election-misinformation case studies.

- Source page created: [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025]]
- Entity pages created: [[Stanford HAI]], [[AI Index]], [[Nestor Maslej]]
- Concept pages created: [[enterprise-ai-adoption]], [[responsible-ai]], [[generative-ai]], [[foundation-models]], [[ai-benchmarks]]
- Index updated: 1 source line + 3 entity lines + 5 concept lines = 9 new index entries.
- Notable choices: deferred ~30 wikilinkable mentions (companies like OpenAI/Anthropic/Google DeepMind, individuals like Brynjolfsson/Manyika, all individual benchmarks like MMLU/GPQA) to avoid stub-spam — they appear as dangling wikilinks ready to be promoted to standalone pages when the next theme-aligned source surfaces them. The `ai-benchmarks` concept page acts as a roster/umbrella for now.
- Total file touch: 11 (1 source + 3 entities + 5 concepts + index + log) — within the design's 10–15 expected for a moderately rich source.

## [2026-04-28] refactor | added kind: project to entity schema

The [[AI Index]] is a project/initiative within [[Stanford HAI]], not an org per se — but the entity-page `kind:` enum in design §5.2 only allows `person | org | product | place | event`. Extended to include `project`. Updated design doc §5.2 and decision log §18.

## [2026-04-28] ingest | MIT Sloan — How to boost your organization's AI maturity level

Second ingest. Kristin Burnham (writer), MIT Sloan / Ideas Made to Matter, Oct 7 2025 — reporting on a research briefing by [[Stephanie Woerner]], [[Peter Weill]], Ina Sebastian, Evgeny Káganer at [[MIT CISR]]. 3 pages of content. Underlying research: MIT CISR 2022 Future Ready Survey (N=721) + 2024 interviews at 9 enterprises.

- Source page created: [[2026-04-28-mit-sloan-ai-maturity]]
- Entity pages created: [[MIT CISR]], [[Stephanie Woerner]], [[Peter Weill]]
- Thread page opened: [[ai-maturity-measurement-comparison]] — for tracking the cross-source methodology question (AI Index vs. MIT CISR vs. future sources)
- Concept pages enriched:
  - [[enterprise-ai-adoption]] — major: added the Four Stages of AI Maturity framework, Four S challenges, Stage 2→3 financial inflection, Guardian + Italgas worked examples; updated Debates section with cross-source methodology comparison
  - [[responsible-ai]] — light: added "RAI as operationalized stewardship" subsection with Guardian + Italgas examples
  - [[generative-ai]] — light: added "Agents in enterprise AI maturity" subsection mapping autonomous-agent role to Stage 3+
- Index updated: 1 source + 3 entity + 1 thread = 5 new entries; concept summaries refreshed.
- **Contradiction check: no contradictions** with [[2026-04-28-ai-index-report-2025|AI Index 2025]]. Strong qualitative convergence on "high adoption, low maturity, value capture is hard" — though the two sources use different instruments and definitions. The methodology divergence is itself the topic of the new [[ai-maturity-measurement-comparison]] thread.
- Notable choices: Ina Sebastian, Evgeny Káganer, Kristin Burnham (writer), Guardian Life Insurance, Italgas, IESE Business School, MIT Sloan all left as dangling wikilinks for now — single-source coverage; will create pages when they recur.
- Total file touch: 11 (1 source + 3 entities + 1 thread + 3 concept enrichments + index + log + raw PDF).
